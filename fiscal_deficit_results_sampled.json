However, it does not provide specific details on future government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would directly impact the fiscal deficit. The Chief Economic Advisor mentions the challenge of keeping the fiscal deficit under balance but does not indicate whether it will increase or decrease. The focus is more on managing inflation and growth rather than providing a clear prediction on the fiscal deficit's future direction.

Reddy, whose differences with the then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in 2004 on opening the banking system to foreign ownership made him consider quitting the post. Reddy, the RBI Governor between 2003 and 2008 who has written an autobiography \u2018Advice and Dissent \u2014 My Life in Public Service\u2019, feels that best decisions do not come out of \u201cpleasing each other.\u201d However, the 76-year old former central banker, known for frank expression of his views, was reticent about coming out with them on current issues like demonetisation, government ordinance on non-performing assets (NPAs) and the exit of Raghuram Rajan as Governor.\n\n\u201cThe difference of opinion between RBI and the government is not a bad thing at all. It\u2019s a good thing. It should not be worried about. As a general view, these are two institutions, if they keep agreeing with each other, then where are the two institutions?\u201d he said in an interview to IANS. He was asked about the current RBI Governor Urjit Patel\u2019s public statement recently when he said that members of the Monetary Policy Committee refused to meet finance ministry officials who had called them on the eve of MPC meeting on monetary policy review.\n\n\u201cThere are two problems \u2014 being in a smooth relationship and pleasing each other\u2026the best decision doesn\u2019t come out of pleasing each other. I want to make it very clear, most of what happens are matters of judgement. All good things happen and there are some differences which are not bad. Outcome is a result of discussions. It is dynamic,\u201d he said. Reddy said the way newspapers report, people imagine that \u201cwe (Chidambaram and he) were quarrelling. The fact is that we were not quarrelling. There was a genuine difference of opinion, difference in judgement. And together we have done lot more than people can imagine.\u201d\n\nYou may also like to watch:\n\nAsked about the fact that he unconditionally apologised to the minister on the issue though Chidambaram agreed with his judgement, Reddy said, \u201cIf somebody is hurt, we should apologise. I don\u2019t care whether I was right or wrong, he was a minister. In the final analysis, he is accountable and he represents the democratic government and the fact that, in my view, it is remarkable that PM Manmohan Singh, FM Chidambaram or Jaswant Singh (FM) or (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee (PM), all the people had energy. In the final analysis it is the government that has to permit debate and discussion.\u201d\n\nHe said when there is an issue between the minister and a \u201ccommon man\u201d there must have been some problems. \u201cInstead of going into them, I felt that he has been fundamentally very positive in terms of discussions though there have been differences. We don\u2019t want to hurt somebody.\u201d To a question about his threat to quit on the issue of foreign banks to acquire Indian banks, Reddy sought to play it down saying even in a family one feels like going out but does not do it.\n\n\u201cSometimes you strongly feel and the other person understands the strength of those feelings and revisits the matter. Wasn\u2019t that what happened at that time. It is not a threat.\u201d He said that Chidambaram would have discussed it with the then Prime Minister \u201cthat this man is so experienced and if he is feeling so strongly\u2026 I did feel strongly at that point of time that adequate opportunities should be given and I always believe that sometimes the difference of opinion is serious. The right thing to do is that if you are there then you should implement is most faithfully, with full commitment as a disciplined soldier. If it is impossible from a personal point of view to implement the decision fully and faithfully then I should not be there. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nTo questions about autonomy of the Reserve Bank vis-a-vis the government of the day, Reddy said, \u201cWhere is the question of autonomy? If you lisen to your minister against your wishes, even then the government has the authority to give you directions.\u201d He cited the example of his statement on Tobin Tax in early 2000s when he was the Governor and he had to subsequently issue a clarification at the request of the government.\n\n\u201cI gave a statement. The minister said why did I give the statement. I explained it is the financial sector issue. So then the minister explained that I can answer only academic point not operational point because his point was that its a matter of fiscal policy, not your business,\u201d Reddy said. \u201cI was told that it is having impact on the (stock) market. The matter is that it is on border line, fiscal measure with financial impact. He said that technically you may be right but the impact of your speech is having an effect on the market. Therefore if I had to back and virtually revise, I think I am justified in doing that. Yes, I gave a speech that was right. The consequences of which were unanticipated, the consequences have some implications for the government and therefore it is in the public interest to clear it. That\u2019s the nuance I am trying to impress. In policy making there is a nuance, there is overlapping of responsibility and functions. That is the autonomy or the lack of autonomy.\u201d\n\nTo a question about the demonetisation decision of last year, he declined to give his opinion except to merely say that the country was still awaiting data which is being revised almost every month. \u201cIn india not only the future is uncertain, even the past is uncertain. So they keep revising the data. So in that sense it is premature to arrive at a conclusion. It\u2019s very complex. It\u2019s not strictly like a fiscal measure with financial impact because in demonetisation, with the objective of black money, it\u2019s entirely a tax administration issue.\u201d In a way, he said it seems demonetisation has been used to tackle the issue, which is essentially of tax administration. \u201cDemonetisation is an instrument. Many instruments have failed in the past , you can\u2019t make judgements. I don\u2019t want to make judgements, but the fact remains that it is an extraordinary type of instrument.\u201d\n\nReddy said that there will be lot of people who will be opposed to demonetisation. \u201cIt\u2019s not that everybody has to support when decisions are taken and I have given many instances when I made a proposal and it was changed.\u201d In a similar vein, he refused to give his opinion on the exit of Raghuram Rajan from central bank last year. \u201cThat\u2019s not a question that should be asked. I am not here to give opinions. I don\u2019t think it is appropriate,\u201d he said.",

While the RBI report mentions the importance of withdrawing stimulus once the Covid-19 crisis is resolved, there is no clear indication of immediate fiscal tightening or measures to reduce the deficit. The focus on economic retrenchment and weakened activity implies continued pressure on government finances, likely necessitating sustained or increased spending to support the economy. This scenario points to a potential increase in the fiscal deficit or at least a persistence of elevated deficit levels in the near future.",

That's one question haunting small investors and market veterans alike over the past few weeks. Uday Kotak , India\u2019s richest banker and head of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has a simple answer: it's the glut of money from central banks, and markets' habit of discounting the immediate future!\u201cFirst, there has been a significant monetary expansion by central banks worldwide. Second, investors and analysts have already discounted earnings downside for FY21 and are looking at earnings of FY22 and FY23,\u201d Kotak said.Hopeful buying by retail and institutional investors has lifted the 30-share index Sensex by 41 per cent from March lows while BSE Smallcap index has surged 45 per cent and BSE Midcap index has climbed 39 per cent.Kotak advised the government and industry to take a cue from stock market investors and not worry too much about the current fiscal year\u2019s slowdown. He said they should instead plan and work towards a medium-term growth strategy.As Covid-19 ravages throughout India affecting people\u2019s health and businesses alike, Kotak said his bank has devised three filters for loan sanctioning so that Kotak Mahindra Bank doesn\u2019t fall ill.\u201cFirst, we develop a view on the sectors we are comfortable with. Second, we look at levels of fixed operating costs of individual companies\u2014the higher the level, the more cautious we are. And third, we are mindful about how we deal with businesses or companies with high leverage,\u201d he said.But the bank will not step away from lending to medium and small enterprises as the central government has stepped in as a guarantor, Kotak said.The finance ministry earlier this week said banks have sanctioned loans of about Rs 1,14,502 crore under the Rs 3-lakh crore Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for the MSME sector. However, disbursements against this stood at Rs 56,091.18 crore till July 4.Kotak said the pandemic has also presented an opportunity to grow further into non-lending businesses. \u201cFinally, we see an opportunity to grow our customer franchise in non-credit risk areas of business\u2060\u2014advisory, insurance, securities, wealth management and asset management,\u201d he said.The 61-year-old banker stressed that as the situation evolves, India\u2019s banking system will need a recapitalisation as the pandemic is likely to hit the capital position of lenders.India\u2019s \u201cbanking sector\u2019s loan book is about Rs 100 lakh crore and the total capital of all banks in India is about Rs 11 to 12 lakh crore. So, if 4-5 per cent of loans turn bad due to Covid , the capital position of the banking sector will get impacted by 40 per cent.\u201d said Kotak.In a letter to his shareholders, Kotak said Moody\u2019s recent downgrade of India\u2019s sovereign rating, citing widening of fiscal deficit, does not worry him much. But he also said we should not be in denial and focus on the areas where we can improve; for example, healthcare and education to build a better foundation for India\u2019s future.Kokak accepted that the financial sector is in the middle of a storm, and all the boats will have to navigate rough seas. Drawing the example of \u2018unsinkable\u2019 Titanic, he said no matter how strongly positioned a bank is, it needs to finetune its safety mechanisms.\u201cIn that context, we have been conservative leading up to this crisis. Prioritizing Return of Capital over Return on Capital is our basic mantra as a leveraged business. Hopefully, that will stand us in good stead,\u201d Kotak said.He added that the recent qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue, which helped Kotak Mahindra Bank raise Rs 7,400 crore, has bolstered the capital position even further.The Bank\u2019s Tier-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) which was about 17 per cent as on March 31, 2020 has gone up to over 20 per cent post issue, and the bank\u2019s consolidated net worth has gone up from about Rs 67,000 crore as on March 31, 2020 to over Rs 74,000 crore.\u201cThis additional capital will support the bank in dealing with contingencies or financing business opportunities\u2060\u2014organic and/or inorganic,\u201d Kotak said.",

However, disbursements against this stood at Rs 56,091.18 crore till July 4.Kotak said the pandemic has also presented an opportunity to grow further into non-lending businesses. \u201cFinally, we see an opportunity to grow our customer franchise in non-credit risk areas of business\u2060\u2014advisory, insurance, securities, wealth management and asset management,\u201d he said.The 61-year-old banker stressed that as the situation evolves, India\u2019s banking system will need a recapitalisation as the pandemic is likely to hit the capital position of lenders.India\u2019s \u201cbanking sector\u2019s loan book is about Rs 100 lakh crore and the total capital of all banks in India is about Rs 11 to 12 lakh crore. So, if 4-5 per cent of loans turn bad due to Covid , the capital position of the banking sector will get impacted by 40 per cent.\u201d said Kotak.In a letter to his shareholders, Kotak said Moody\u2019s recent downgrade of India\u2019s sovereign rating, citing widening of fiscal deficit, does not worry him much. But he also said we should not be in denial and focus on the areas where we can improve; for example, healthcare and education to build a better foundation for India\u2019s future.Kokak accepted that the financial sector is in the middle of a storm, and all the boats will have to navigate rough seas. Drawing the example of \u2018unsinkable\u2019 Titanic, he said no matter how strongly positioned a bank is, it needs to finetune its safety mechanisms.\u201cIn that context, we have been conservative leading up to this crisis. Prioritizing Return of Capital over Return on Capital is our basic mantra as a leveraged business. Hopefully, that will stand us in good stead,\u201d Kotak said.He added that the recent qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue, which helped Kotak Mahindra Bank raise Rs 7,400 crore, has bolstered the capital position even further.The Bank\u2019s Tier-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR) which was about 17 per cent as on March 31, 2020 has gone up to over 20 per cent post issue, and the bank\u2019s consolidated net worth has gone up from about Rs 67,000 crore as on March 31, 2020 to over Rs 74,000 crore.\u201cThis additional capital will support the bank in dealing with contingencies or financing business opportunities\u2060\u2014organic and/or inorganic,\u201d Kotak said.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article primarily discusses the economic and financial sector impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on the banking sector and market behavior. It mentions Uday Kotak's views on the need for recapitalization of India's banking system due to potential loan defaults, which could indirectly affect the fiscal deficit if the government steps in to support the banks. However, there is no explicit mention of future government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or specific fiscal policy changes that would directly indicate an increase or decrease in the fiscal deficit. The reference to Moody's downgrade of India\u2019s sovereign rating due to a widening fiscal deficit is noted, but it does not provide a clear prediction about the future direction of the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the article does not provide a clear indication of the future fiscal deficit direction.",

This revenue would be used to subsidize fuel retailers, thereby preventing a direct increase in fuel prices for consumers. While the windfall tax could increase government revenue in the short term, the use of these funds to subsidize fuel retailers suggests a potential increase in government spending. This could offset the revenue gains and potentially lead to a higher fiscal deficit if the spending exceeds the additional tax revenue. However, the article does not provide explicit details on the scale of the windfall tax or the projected spending on subsidies, making it difficult to assess the net impact on the fiscal deficit. Overall, there is a hint that fiscal deficit might increase due to higher spending, but the lack of specific projections limits the certainty of this outcome.",

While the focus is on monetary policy, there are indirect implications for the fiscal deficit. The government is constrained in boosting public investment due to its commitment to fiscal consolidation, which recently led to a sovereign credit rating upgrade by Moody's. This suggests that the government is cautious about increasing spending, which could otherwise widen the fiscal deficit. However, the article does not explicitly predict any significant changes in government spending or tax revenue that would directly impact the fiscal deficit.

There are wide divergences in state-level performance as they are getting exposed to increasing competition, said the report titled \u2018States of Growth\u2019 by ratings firm Crisil. The performance of states was gauged on parameters like growth, inflation and fiscal health. \u201cGujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana were the fastest growing states between fiscals 2013 and 2017. Bringing up the bottom were Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala,\u201d said the report. Gujarat was the top performer in construction and manufacturing growth, while Chhattisgarh and Haryana were among the top performers in manufacturing and trade, transportation and communication services, it said. \u201cThese states, therefore, are likely to have been more successful than others in job creation. In Gujarat specifically, the share of manufacturing has jumped from 28.4 per cent to 34.4 per cent of gross value added (GVA)\u2013which is close to levels seen in China.\u201d\n\nThese states recorded the highest growth in aggregate GVA of labour-intensive sectors. The report pointed out that the poorer states aren\u2019t growing faster.

However, the mention of \"tighter fiscal policy in the near future\" suggests a potential reduction in government spending or increased revenue measures, which could positively influence the fiscal deficit. On the other hand, higher crude oil prices and inflationary pressures could strain government finances, particularly if subsidies or welfare programs are expanded to mitigate the impact on consumers. Overall, the article does not provide a clear or direct prediction about the future fiscal deficit, but the hint of tighter fiscal policy leans slightly toward a positive direction.  \n\n**",

We seem to be doing the same. I do not need an explanation for this, says, Head-Equity Funds,The first thing to keep in mind is that the global backdrop is pretty solid. The kind of fiscal support which has been given in the developed economies is unprecedented and to that extent, emerging markets including India have not been that aggressive because we do not have the ability to be so aggressive on the fiscal side.As we get through vaccinations, remember pretty much all the adults in the US will get vaccinated within the next two months. So we are increasingly looking at normalisation of the global economy. For India, this quarter is going to be difficult but the overall outlook, given the supportive fiscal policies and, monetary policies as well with the Fed still talking about rate hikes way out into \u201823-24 and waiting to see growth pick up before acting. All that leaves the global template very supportive for a pickup in global growth, which should be good for India as well.I am not an epidemiologist so I cannot really comment on those curves and the way they behave but certainly the data we see suggest that things have started to get better in some of the states and metros which got hit early. But this is also a global context that we should be aware of. We are not the first country to experience the second wave. The US, Europe have seen second waves. There have been third waves also. It is not like those markets necessarily reacted.I am not trying to understand the moral persuasion of the market or provide a narrative. It is what it is. Markets have powered through second and third waves in other parts of the world. We seem to be doing the same. I do not have an explanation for it. I do not need an explanation for this.I will go back to what I said earlier, go back and look at the data. We are not the first country to have a second wave. The US had the second wave all the way through November and December of 2020. Look at the market action over there. It did not respond to that at all. So as I said, I cannot explain it but that is the way markets have behaved all over the world. This is very painful. There has been loss of near and dear ones. It has been very tragic but this is the way markets have behaved and so there is no point ruminating over it.Now if you are coming to whether there will be a setback to the GDP data that was forecast a month or two ago, the earnings forecast, certainly there is going to be an impact. Depending on the part of the country, we have lost six weeks to upwards of eight weeks of economic activity. The year being of 52 weeks, effectively we are chopping 10% to 15% of that GDP number. So, real GDP estimates of 11.5-12% are set to drop well below 10%.The only good thing from a data point of view is that the April-May period is any way a quiet period in terms of economic activity. So while there is a setback, it is not as dramatic as if the setback were to have happened in the Jan-March quarter. So if we are going to see those GDP estimates cut, the automobile company, the retail company -- all are saying that only about 30-50% of retail outlets have been functional in many parts of the country in recent weeks. Is that going to affect earnings? Without doubt. You got a 36-38% Bloomberg consensus EPS growth for the Nifty50 in FY22. Is there a risk to that? Certainly, if you look at the domestic cyclical areas. There is risk to those earnings numbers.Some of the commodity companies which are driven more by what is happening in a global context might actually surprise on the upside in terms of earnings. But domestic cyclicals are weak and therefore they will be cuts in those earnings estimates as well.In the middle of February after the Budget, there was a lot of optimism and some of those factors have not gone away, whether it is record low tax rate or record low interest rates or whether it is supportive fiscal policy in India. Last year, the government carried out Some of the reforms. If the medium term economic uptrend starts to get questioned, that is when the market will run into a lot more in terms of challenges.I do not think you look at commodity prices for recovery. You look for economic activity to pick up and we did say that by the time we got to Jan-March 21, which is the quarter where activity levels had more or less rebounded and was ahead of the pre-Covid levels of activity. There is continuing cyclical recovery as you see demand coming back in some of the consumer cyclical areas and you start to see some investment activity aided both by the government as well as the private sector.Though I think it will be slower for the private sector, but as it starts to revive, that is the trajectory of the medium term improvement in economic activity. The reality is that even before the pandemic, in 2018-19 India was already in a period of deceleration in terms of growth and then the pandemic brought everything to grinding halt last year in the first quarter. We have been in some kind of a recovery since then.If you look at the high frequency data that we have got in May, activity levels have come off but they have not dropped as sharply or significantly as they did in the first quarter last year. We can get through this in terms of normalisation of economic activity and we have seen the experience of the other countries as well. When the second wave tails off, that is the opportunity for the economic activity to normalise.My first input would be to stop thinking about stocks from an ownership perspective. By blindly saying PSU versus private, we are missing the whole point. It comes down to looking at companies which have the fundamental ability to grow and among the PSUs, it is a narrower set of companies which are fundamentally strong in the sectors that they operate in. That could make a bottom up case for investment but I am not a fan of this broad brush of PSUs as a whole.The only good thing on the PSU front which comes from the ownership perspective is that the government of India has sold as much as it can in companies and brought its holdings down to 51% in a large number of enterprises. That flow of constant supply is something which has gone away. But that does not mean that you stop looking at individual merits of the companies before buying them.I do not see things like a PSU wave or certainly not the way that I would approve of looking at investing in stocks if we find sectors in which some of the PSU companies are very competitive. If the government of India is genuinely looking to privatise them and they believe there is an opportunity, we own some of those stocks but it is got to be a bottom up case. It is not just a simple case of let us buy all PSUs or let us not buy PSUs.Clearly the runup in commodity prices has been dramatic. Across the board, many of these -- the whole metals and mining sector prices and profitability are at record highs.Interestingly, even the FAO\u2019s agri price index is up 70% over the last year or so and therefore there is a boom happening there as well. The only commodity which has not gone ballistic to record highs is oil which is not necessarily a bad thing. It is a good thing from everybody\u2019s point of view. But I think there are some challenges here in terms of the interpretation.If you look at things like steel, China accounts for 50% of global demand and supply roughly and that economy is now trying to readjust itself both in terms of the fact that they would like higher quality growth, more growth led by technology rather than the old smoke stack driven growth that we saw in the previous decade.So to my mind beyond a point this sort of run up in commodity prices is going to run into a very simple challenge that the biggest driver of demand which has really been China is not looking to grow its economy the way it has in the past. Also, the transition from a very poor profitability to a high level of profitability has been very sudden.Some of the EBITDA margins that steel companies are making in India today in rupee terms are absolute record levels and when you have gone to record levels in terms of profitability, then I would tend to get a little muted in my excitement about these cyclical companies.Looking at the PEs or the EV/EBITDA at this point of time is meaningless. When you look at cyclical companies when commodity prices are high, when EBITDA margins or EBITDA per ton is at a record level, you will see valuations start to correct because they need to come back to the average cycle level.You buy commodity companies when margins are very low and stated PEs or price or EV/EBITDA maybe very high because of surplus profitability. The cycle has been very dramatic and has already played out phenomenally over the course of a year, I would hold my horses given the transition in profitability and given the fact that China is not going to be a global driver of demand in this complex going ahead.Housing is interesting. People do not realise that the housing sector is almost about a quarter of total capital investment that happens in the economy. It has been a soft spot for many years but nothing like record low interest rates and the sort of tax breaks and etc. which have been given both to at an individual buyer level as well as to developers to get the real estate cycle moving. That is something we would tend to be positive on incrementally. There is a part of capex that we are more positive on happening in real estate then necessarily with the private corporate sector at this point of time.The other interesting area would be automobiles. Automobiles sector has been through a very difficult cycle going back all the way to the festival season of calendar 2018. In three years, volumes have gone nowhere or have gone negative and this is an area where we still think that the structural growth story in automobiles in terms of the demand that is likely to come from consumers as they move up the income cycle and look to improve their quality of life.In automobile, the structural story is still intact and therefore this three year adverse cycle actually is creating a good opportunity to position for demand normalisation.The domestic healthcare sector and pharmaceuticals the sector has done well in the last one year but really it is coming through a period of two-three years of intense pain. They have had to readjust their business structure, the domestic opportunity remain very attractive but they ran into significant challenges on the pricing side and the generic markets globally and also with quality related issues. One by one, we are seeing companies addressing these challenges and get past them.Remember these companies are globally very competitive. It is one of the few sectors in which you will find a large number of Indian companies being globally competitive. We are quite excited about the entire pharmaceutical plus healthcare space; automobiles and real estate.As I said pharma and healthcare is something that we still like and the domestic market opportunity is still very attractive. It is highly profitable, it has got very good growth characteristics. It is just unfortunate fact of life that as incomes go up you get more and more of chronic lifestyle related conditions which require a lifetime of treatment. So this is a good growth opportunity for the domestic companies and added to that, the organised sector of healthcare, which is the whole hospital diagnostic place, has been growing again on the back of spending ability and the development of the health insurance sector.So we are quite positive on this domestic healthcare space. The export end of that had been challenged by safety issues and also quality issues and also by pricing issues we think the worst is sort of behind on that front as well. So this is a sector where we would stay incrementally positive on the medium term.The financial sector has been the bellwether of this market. It is the largest sector in the benchmark but it has gone through a difficult period over the last 12-18 months because of the pandemic.This is the first time in almost 20 years I am actually seeing that a handful of banks have been proactive in terms of providing for potential losses. They actually started providing for losses in the March 20 quarter when the pandemic had just about hit.Secondly they have went out and raised capital as a pre-emptive measure to strengthen balance sheets.Thirdly, many of them have built excess buffers within the P&L. We have not seen this kind of a behaviour from some of these banks in the previous credit cycle 2013-2015 or even if you go back to the late 90s credit cycle. Typically the attitude was deny, deny, regulatory forbearance but then you wait four to five years before you start to clean it up.Now some of the points that I made may not be true of every bank within the sector or every financial lending institution within the sector but certainly it is true of a handful of these institutions. So while at a sector level it is hard to get dramatically overweight given that the sector is already 32% of the benchmark, within that, we are selectively very confident that a strong consolidation story is going to play out.Some of these institutions navigated the credit side and asset side risks well over the last one year. They have built their buffers, they have got high capital adequacy and they have got the trust of depositors or the bond markets. The case for incremental growth accruing to them is far stronger than anything I have seen in the last few years. One has to be cautious within the aggregate secto because companies are very different but there are five or six where we personally and many of our funds are invested with a strong active weight. We think these guys are going to come out of this difficult period with their foot on the accelerator, better margins and gains in market share.",

Typically the attitude was deny, deny, regulatory forbearance but then you wait four to five years before you start to clean it up.Now some of the points that I made may not be true of every bank within the sector or every financial lending institution within the sector but certainly it is true of a handful of these institutions. So while at a sector level it is hard to get dramatically overweight given that the sector is already 32% of the benchmark, within that, we are selectively very confident that a strong consolidation story is going to play out.Some of these institutions navigated the credit side and asset side risks well over the last one year. They have built their buffers, they have got high capital adequacy and they have got the trust of depositors or the bond markets. The case for incremental growth accruing to them is far stronger than anything I have seen in the last few years. One has to be cautious within the aggregate secto because companies are very different but there are five or six where we personally and many of our funds are invested with a strong active weight. We think these guys are going to come out of this difficult period with their foot on the accelerator, better margins and gains in market share.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article does not provide a clear or direct prediction about the future fiscal deficit of India. It discusses various economic factors such as global economic recovery, vaccination progress, and sector-specific performance (e.g., commodities, healthcare, automobiles, real estate). While it mentions supportive fiscal and monetary policies, it does not explicitly state whether these policies will lead to an increase or decrease in the fiscal deficit. The article also highlights challenges such as GDP and earnings forecast cuts due to the pandemic, but these are not directly tied to fiscal deficit projections. Without explicit information on government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes, the future direction of the fiscal deficit remains unclear. Therefore, the article is neutral regarding the future fiscal deficit.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article provides several key insights into the future direction of the fiscal deficit. Firstly, the government has decided to cancel a Rs 20,000 crore borrowing, which suggests a reduction in immediate borrowing needs. More importantly, the Finance Minister has outlined a clear plan for fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-2026, with a steady decline over the period. The budget for the next fiscal year (2021-22) has pegged the fiscal deficit at 6.8%, down from 9.5% in the current fiscal year. This indicates a planned reduction in the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the gross borrowing for the next year is projected to be around Rs 12 lakh crore, which is lower than the revised estimate for the current year. These points collectively suggest a positive trajectory for the fiscal deficit in the future.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged and its measures to manage liquidity in the system. It mentions the government's borrowing plans for FY18, pegging total borrowing at Rs 5.8 lakh crore and market borrowing at Rs 3.5 lakh crore. While the article does not explicitly predict the future fiscal deficit, the government's significant borrowing plans suggest potential pressure on fiscal resources. Increased borrowing typically indicates higher fiscal deficits, as it implies the government is spending more than it is collecting in revenues. The article does not provide any indications of measures to reduce the deficit, such as increased tax revenues or reduced spending. Therefore, the implication is that the fiscal deficit may increase or remain elevated.",

    "full_article": "Two months after the federal elections of September 26, Germany finally has clarity on the composition the new government. For the first time, a disparate trio \u2014 the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens, and the neo-liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) \u2014 have sealed a coalition agreement . Dubbed the \u2018traffic light coalition\u2019 on the basis of the party colours (the SPD\u2019s red, the yellow of the FDP, and the Greens), the new dispensation will see the SPD\u2019s Olaf Scholz \u2014 Finance Minister in the outgoing Cabinet \u2014 succeed Angela Merkel as Germany\u2019s new Chancellor.\n\nThe three parties are not natural allies. Until the election results came out, it was believed that the SPD\u2019s preferred partners would be the Greens and the communist Die Linke (The Left), as all of them are left-leaning in varying degrees. But the Left posted its worst performance ever, winning just 39 seats. The SPD emerged as the largest party with 206 seats, just ahead of the 197 secured by the centre-right Christian Democratic Union\u2019s (CDU), while the Greens came third with 118 seats. The FDP and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) finished with 92 and 83 seats, respectively.\n\nIn the 736-seat Bundestag, 369 seats are needed for a majority. The SPD and the Greens together had 324, and were 35 short. Had the Left even matched its performance in the last elections (69 seats), they might have been in the government. But their dismal show meant the SPD \u2014 which was not interested in another \u2018grand coalition\u2019 with the CDU \u2014 had no option but to get in bed with the business-friendly Free Democrats, and convince the Greens to do so as well.\n\nStarting from October 21, 300 negotiators from the three parties, split into 22 working groups, got down to work behind closed doors hammering out policy positions. After five weeks of intense negotiations, on November 24, the freshly minted allies announced at a joint press conference in Berlin that a deal has been finalised. The coalition agreement, which runs into 177 pages, outlines a common minimum programme and indicates how the ministries will be divided. All three parties have to get the pact internally ratified before government formation, which is expected to happen in the second week of December.\n\nThe main thrust of the coalition agreement is climate protection, with a pronounced focus on making German industry climate-neutral and on digitalisation, and fiscal discipline. The agreement, however, is widely perceived as less of an actual manual of governance and more a marketing brochure that would help sell the ideologically discordant alliance to the rank and file of the respective parties. Therefore, the deal, erected on hard compromises, offers each party something concrete to take back to their core constituency.\n\nThe SPD has managed to get two of its campaign promises \u2014 raising the minimum wage to \u20ac12 and build 400,000 houses to resolve a housing crisis \u2014 into the coalition agreement. While these measures would be anathema to the laissez faire FDP, it has, in turn, had its say on the taxation front, forcing the SPD to drop the idea of a wealth tax, and agree that there would be neither an increase in tax rates nor a relaxation of the curbs on borrowing. The Greens, on the other hand, have gained a policy commitment that by 2030 (brought forward from 2038), Germany will phase out coal and have 80% of its energy demand met through renewables.\n\nDivision of Ministries\n\nAs for the division of Ministries, the SPD, in addition to the chancellorship, will get six portfolios, including Defence and the Interior Ministry. The FDP will get four \u2014 the all-important Finance Ministry, Education and Research, Justice, and the Ministry of Transport and Digital Affairs. The Greens will get charge of Foreign Affairs, an expanded economic affairs portfolio that also includes energy and climate protection, family affairs, environment, and agriculture. It\u2019s clear that FDP leader Christian Lindner will be the new Finance Minister, while Green Party honchos Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck will be in charge of foreign affairs and economic affairs, respectively.\n\nIn general, with the ideological proclivities of the coalition partners cancelling each other out, the new regime is expected to continue Ms. Merkel\u2019s legacy of incremental change, with bold policy departures unlikely. For instance, Ms. Baerbock as Foreign Minister is likely to continue the Merkel line, which means the trans-Atlantic partnerships with the U.S., NATO and the U.K. will get top billing.\n\nGermany will also continue to press for greater EU integration, while remaining open to dialogue with Russia and protecting trade ties with China. However, one could expect Ms. Baerbock to up the ante on human rights issues, which could have implications for Russia and China.\n\nOn the economic front, the southern European economies such as Italy and Spain may not be happy about a fiscal hawk such as Mr. Lindner becoming Finance Minister. While these countries want greater flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) \u2014 which lays down the outer limits for government debt and deficit for EU member-states \u2014 Mr. Lindner has made it clear that the SGP already has more than enough flexibility in its current form.\n\nImmigration laws\n\nAmong the sections of the coalition agreement that have attracted a lot of attention are those proposing radical changes to immigration and citizenship laws. The new government will aim to offer dual citizenship to migrants (at present, available only for EU and Swiss citizens), and make it easier for refugees and asylum-seekers to bring their relatives to Germany. They will also make it easier for long-term residents to become naturalised citizens. The other highlights of the coalition deal include lowering the voting age to 16 and legalising the sale of cannabis.\n\nWhile these measures may go down well with the parties\u2019 vote base, there is an elephant in the room: the Bundesrat, or the upper chamber of German Parliament that represents the 16 States. Here, the traffic light coalition doesn\u2019t have a majority, while the CDU and its sister party CSU (Christian Social Union) are a part of the government in 10 out of the 16 States. In other words, the new government will find it tough to push through major legislation without getting the opposition CDU also on board.\n\nInterestingly, the most pressing issues facing Mr. Scholz as he takes charge don\u2019t even figure in the coalition agreement: a resurgent COVID-19 crisis, rising tensions between Belarus and Poland, and Russia making aggressive military moves in Ukraine.\n\nWhat Mr. Scholz has going for him is a track record of being able to navigate conflicting interests to further his own political agenda \u2014 starting off as a labour lawyer, he successfully positioned himself as someone on the rightwing of the centre-left SPD; after the federal elections, he could convince both the Greens and the Free Democrats to join hands and back him (the Free Democrats had infamously walked out of coalition talks with Ms. Merkel after the 2017 elections), and now he has to do more of the same for the next four years. As head of a traffic light coalition, his likely approach to policy decisions would be to start slowly, pause until the signal turns a clear green, and proceed with abundant caution, keeping well under the speed limit.",

Key points include:\n1. **Fiscal Discipline**: The coalition agreement emphasizes fiscal discipline, with no increase in tax rates or relaxation of borrowing curbs, suggesting a commitment to controlling the deficit.\n2. **Spending Commitments**: The SPD has secured commitments to raise the minimum wage and build 400,000 houses, which could increase government spending. However, these are balanced by the FDP's influence in preventing a wealth tax and maintaining fiscal restraint.\n3. **Climate and Digitalization**: The focus on climate protection and digitalization may involve significant investments, but these are likely to be phased and aligned with long-term economic benefits.\n4. **Finance Minister's Stance**: The appointment of FDP leader Christian Lindner as Finance Minister, known for his fiscal hawkishness, reinforces the likelihood of strict adherence to deficit control measures.\n5. **Economic Context**: The article does not suggest",

    "full_article": "India has imposed anti-dumping duty of up to USD 528 per tonne for 5 years on a Chinese polyester yarn used in automobile and other industries. The move will provide a level playing field to domestic players and guard them against below-cost imports. Commerce Ministry\u2019s investigation arm Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) had recommended the duty after a probe into alleged dumping of \u2018High Tenacity Polyester Yarn\u2019 from China.\n\nThe probe followed complaints by the domestic players, who alleged that below-cost import of the yarn from China is hurting the industry in India. The finance ministry has imposed the duty on the product after considering the recommendations of DGAD. \u201cThe anti-dumping duty imposed\u2026shall be effective for a period of five years (unless revoked, superseded or amended earlier) and shall be paid in Indian currency,\u201d the Finance Ministry said in a notification.\n\nThe duty imposed is in the range of USD 174-528 per tonne. High Tenacity Polyester Yarn, also called industrial yarn, is used for manufacture of tyre cord fabric, seat belt webbing, ropes, coated fabric, conveyor belt fabric and automotive hose.\n\nCountries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in below-cost imports. As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of WTO.\n\nThe duty is also aimed at ensuring fair trading practises and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters.

The move will provide a level playing field to domestic players and guard them against below-cost imports. Commerce Ministry\u2019s investigation arm Directorate General of Anti-dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) had recommended the duty after a probe into alleged dumping of \u2018High Tenacity Polyester Yarn\u2019 from China. The probe followed complaints by the domestic players, who alleged that below-cost import of the yarn from China is hurting the industry in India. The finance ministry has imposed the duty on the product after considering the recommendations of DGAD. \u201cThe anti-dumping duty imposed\u2026shall be effective for a period of five years (unless revoked, superseded or amended earlier) and shall be paid in Indian currency,\u201d the Finance Ministry said in a notification. The duty imposed is in the range of USD 174-528 per tonne. High Tenacity Polyester Yarn, also called industrial yarn, is used for manufacture of tyre cord fabric, seat belt webbing, ropes, coated fabric, conveyor belt fabric and automotive hose. Countries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in below-cost imports. As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of WTO. The duty is also aimed at ensuring fair trading practises and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters. India has already imposed anti-dumping duty on several products to check cheap imports from countries including China, with which India has a major concern of widening trade deficit.

While this measure could potentially improve the trade balance by reducing the trade deficit with China, it does not provide any direct indication of future fiscal deficit direction. The article does not mention any changes in government spending, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy reforms that would impact the fiscal deficit. The focus is solely on trade measures, which have a more direct impact on the trade deficit rather than the fiscal deficit. Therefore, there is no clear prediction or implication about the future direction of the fiscal deficit.",

    "full_article": "Nannette Hechler-Fayd'herbe, managing director at Credit Suisse in the International Wealth Management Division in Zurich, recently visited Mumbai. She, along with five of her colleagues, has authored the Credit Suisse Supertrends report that puts into focus investing for the long term; by analysing, evaluating and extrapolating the dynamics of today's global demand situation. Among other aspects, Fayd'herbe spoke about how both millennials and elders are driving demand trends in specific sectors. Edited excerpts:\n\nOne of the major trends over the last decade has been globalisation.\n\nHow do you see this trend impacting stock selection and your choice of asset and geographical markets in the next decade?\n\nAfter years of globalisation, what we are now seeing is a focus on domestic demand. Pulling domestic demand along with growth. It is very clear in emerging markets. China, for example, is at a very natural stage of economic development, that many other developed countries went through previously, to transform the growth model towards a domestic consumer demand led model.\n\nWhat China experienced during the financial crisis is that when the growth model is uniquely focused towards exports, it can suddenly break away because the rest of the world is going through a recession. This is a vulnerable growth model. With the bedrock of the last 15 years of globalisation to look at, it is now time to have a more balanced growth model. China is not the only example, many others in emerging markets are going down this path. They want to continue competing in world trade, they want to continue using investments that are needed for long-term growth, but they also want to encourage their own consumers to consume.\n\nWe are seeing signs of emerging economies moving towards higher consumer-led growth, more service-oriented economy; and that comes extremely naturally. As a consequence, emerging-market brands are coming up. For example, consumers in Asia are very technology savvy, which is driving a lot of the technology companies locally and the influence is visible on the index as well.\n\nIn developed markets, the story is a little different. The home consumer base has been somewhat left on the side and has not fully benefitted from the economic recovery post the financial crisis. For example, unemployment rates have only gradually come down. What you are likely to see in developed markets is a move towards fiscal policy and also support from the government for support domestically. We are back to talking about more inclusive growth, certainly one that creates more domestic jobs and ensures that domestic consumers thrive.\n\nThis is not questioning globalization, rather it is more inclusive growth to make sure the domestic population also benefits.\n\nGlobal liquidity has remained high for many years. Is this the new normal? Or will the shift in fiscal policy focus in the developed economies bring a change?\n\nIt is a fact that flooding the economic system with a lot of liquidity is causing a number of financial-market consequences. One important outcome is the suppression of volatility. There is more liquidity than financial assets to invest in. Generally speaking, this creates asset inflation. If you are going to gradually slow the pace of adding liquidity, then stop the active injection of liquidity and then gradually retrieve it, then the first question is what does it mean for volatility?\n\nPractically speaking, over time if liquidity is less available then the VIX (volatility index; formally \u2018VIX - CBOE Volatility Index\u2019), which is at around 10, can maybe move closer to the historical norm. If volatility is expected to move up, investors can think about taking advantage of the current low volatility and protect portfolios. In times of low volatility, the premium to hedge your portfolio is also attractive.\n\nThe implications are very practical.\n\nAre investors across the world taking more risks?\n\nCertainly in fixed income we are seeing more risk-taking behaviour. Private investors starved for yield have tried to reach the same yield as they had before.\n\nHowever, today that yield can be found only with higher risk; you have seen that with a compression of credit spreads. Even speculative-grade credit spreads are really tight today. Some private investors, who are not sophisticated, are investing in bonds that are even non-rated.\n\nOn the bond side there is a lot more risk-taking behaviour chasing yield; people are not aware that credit spreads are there to compensate for the risk. On the equity side, I wouldn\u2019t say there has been too much risk-taking behaviour. Even though volatility is abnormally low, we are not seeing equity overweight positions. On an average they are still below the historical levels and we can\u2019t say everybody is driven to participate and allocate more to equities and therefore run more risk. But for sure, volatilities are low and people should not think this environment can continue for long. One should think about the opportunities in protecting one\u2019s portfolio at this stage.\n\nIn Credit Suisse\u2019s Supertrends report you present the case for a multi-polar world with rising inequality and angry societies.\n\nThis is visible in various pockets globally. How much of it is a risk versus an opportunity?\n\nOften times, it's both. If you speak economically about a multi-polar world, as we discussed the focus for important economies is on a balanced growth model\u2014one where they can balance domestic and external sectors\u2014this is a stabilising impact on the multi-polar world.\n\nPurchasing manager indices (PMIs) throughout the world are moving up. It means that many corporations around the world are more optimistic about the future and tend to invest more and trade more. This is like a virtuous trade cycle that is attached to economic multi-polarity.\n\nAnother aspect is this political and geopolitical outcome\u2014you can think of it as risk attached to it. We are not political specialists. For investors the more concerning side of multi-polarity, where people don\u2019t really know what the future is made of, is leading in particular an emphasis on security. This includes cyber security. Future threats are going to be very different.\n\nNational and international events of hacking have made clear these new threats for corporations as well. Therefore, in the future we have to consider economic security.\n\nIn financial markets and investments, think about stocks of those companies that are leading in that technology. We think a lot of investments by corporations will be around improving security. Increasing amount of commerce is done digitally, and security around this is not yet up to speed.\n\nOne of the trends that we see in India, too, is higher life expectancy; and as a result, people live longer into retirement. What does this opportunity translate to in terms of global demand?\n\nIt\u2019s a very multi-faceted economic model that is opening up. Population aging is coming with a structural demand for healthcare-linked goods and services. It is clear that for every additional year of life that we enjoy, there is a probability of having a chronic disease at some point. When you look at what type of chronic diseases tend to come with old age, you end up with oncology needs, dementia and biotechnology as the solutions to that. There is also heart disease. There is a very clear first analysis on population aging, which has an immediate impact on healthcare.\n\nThe next step is to talk about the funding of all that health cost. This brings focus to the insurance sector, which is likely to have the same structural trend as population aging.\n\nWhether it is health insurance, life insurance, annuities or asset management; all are going to be in high demand by all the individuals who end up considering living costs beyond retirement.\n\nThen again, it impacts consumption patterns. People who have retired and are relatively in a healthy state, can travel. They are looking towards prolonging healthy living. They are also focused on sports and fitness. Lot of cosmetic companies are also focussed on that powerful population base.\n\nAlso, housing is going to be a big topic. Housing today is not always senior friendly. People will want access to campuses where they can live independently at an old age, they look for proximity to services and facilities. From a property development standpoint, a lot of interesting collaborations between health, hospitals as well as housing will be seen.\n\nBoth infrastructure and technology are important aspects in global growth. Can we continue to assess their potential separately or is there an overlap in terms of the future trend?\n\nIn the past, it was difficult to ascertain if technology increased productivity at a macro level. It enhanced client experience, it certainly made a number of companies cash rich, but there is not much evidence to suggest that at an aggregate level it has helped in increasing productivity.\n\nOne thing, however, that is evidenced is that the good-old brick mortar infrastructure raises productivity for sure. Things like ensuring access to power, roads, clean drinking water\u2014all lead to an increase in productivity.\n\nIn the years after the financial crisis, and then in Europe due to the debt crisis, investment in public infrastructure simply went down. There was no financial means and no possibility to go after that. There is an accumulation of infrastructure needs in Europe.\n\nIn emerging markets there is even more of a need; urbanisation is increasing and that requires infrastructure focus, which is not able to keep pace. It is a time where governments will be very open for public-private partnerships, the debt problem has not vanished and they still don\u2019t have the financial means to foot the bills themselves. We think there is going to be a multi-year trend to try and fill the gap that opened up in the last 9 years.\n\nAffordable housing is another form that is missing across the globe.\n\nAfter the utilities, focus will have to come on the basic provision of lodging. Thus, we think brick and mortar infrastructure will do well.\n\nDigital is also another form of infrastructure. We have kept it separate because very different sectors are impacted. Both these have excellent prospects.\n\nThe one trend we can\u2019t ignore is climate change. We are already seeing a shift in the traditional fuel-based car market to electronic cars. The insurance industry is feeling the impact with erratic weather and damage related to that. However, other than in specific portfolios, we don\u2019t see a collaborative focus from asset managers thinking about stock choices linked to climate change.\n\nFor a long time although everybody was clear about the environment, social and governance criteria which have been around for 10 years, industry has not embarked in a big way in seeing this as an investment-related trend.\n\nThere are certain regions that are more sensitive to it than others. Typically, you see ESG criteria and asset managers really active in Europe; Switzerland, Germany and the Nordics being far advanced in this respect. There are some institutional funds which have set an example for best practices in this area, like the Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund. Other regions in the world haven\u2019t yet reached there simply because they are still in the process of creating wealth. There is a very natural cycle in economic development and asset management\u2014you have to reach a certain level of wealth before lending importance to the environmental quality.\n\nWhen you have already created wealth, you will be more concerned about the risks. There is also risk associated with companies which are not focussed on this aspect.\n\nAlong with this natural cycle of growth, there is also a generational aspect, what we call the millennial values. Millennials specifically are very concerned about environmental quality and about climate change, clean energy and so on. As this generation now comes of age in terms of consumer trends and investment trends, they are going to create the demand. The generational transfer that we are now going to start living, in my view, is going to act as a catalyst for ESG criteria as one that they want to invest in. They are interested in creating the impact with their investing.\n\nLast, give us your view on emerging markets and what you find attractive in the Indian market.\n\nWe think both emerging market equity and fixed income is attractive. A lot of the current accounts have improved and this is leading to resilience of emerging markets. Many are offering attractive yields in local currency and we feel internationally people need to get more familiar with this. Interest rate levels in India, for example, are what international investors would want to take a look at. We have a structurally optimistic view on emerging market equities and fixed income.\n\nIn equities we have just updated our 5-year return expectations, particularly in Asia, which is what we see as the best performing market. There is a big gap in what this market represents in world GDP versus market capitalisation. There is more GDP weight than market cap weight.",

There is a very natural cycle in economic development and asset management\u2014you have to reach a certain level of wealth before lending importance to the environmental quality. When you have already created wealth, you will be more concerned about the risks. There is also risk associated with companies which are not focussed on this aspect. Along with this natural cycle of growth, there is also a generational aspect, what we call the millennial values. Millennials specifically are very concerned about environmental quality and about climate change, clean energy and so on. As this generation now comes of age in terms of consumer trends and investment trends, they are going to create the demand. The generational transfer that we are now going to start living, in my view, is going to act as a catalyst for ESG criteria as one that they want to invest in. They are interested in creating the impact with their investing. Last, give us your view on emerging markets and what you find attractive in the Indian market. We think both emerging market equity and fixed income is attractive. A lot of the current accounts have improved and this is leading to resilience of emerging markets. Many are offering attractive yields in local currency and we feel internationally people need to get more familiar with this. Interest rate levels in India, for example, are what international investors would want to take a look at. We have a structurally optimistic view on emerging market equities and fixed income. In equities we have just updated our 5-year return expectations, particularly in Asia, which is what we see as the best performing market. There is a big gap in what this market represents in world GDP versus market capitalisation. There is more GDP weight than market cap weight.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article primarily discusses global economic trends, consumer behavior, and investment strategies, with a focus on emerging markets and developed economies. It mentions a shift towards fiscal policy support in developed markets to ensure inclusive growth and domestic job creation. However, there is no explicit discussion of government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or specific fiscal policy changes that would directly indicate a future increase or decrease in fiscal deficits. The article does touch on infrastructure needs and public-private partnerships, which could imply potential government spending, but it does not provide enough detail to predict the direction of fiscal deficits. Therefore, the article does not offer a clear prediction about future fiscal deficits.",

    "deficit_score": 1,
    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights several factors that suggest a future increase in India's fiscal deficit. Firstly, the government has delayed fiscal consolidation and widened the budget deficit to support economic recovery post-COVID-19. Secondly, the surge in global crude oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict is expected to significantly increase India's import bill, given its heavy reliance on oil imports. This will likely widen the current account deficit, which is projected to increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY22 to 2.6% of GDP in FY23, with risks of an even wider deficit if oil prices remain high. Additionally, the article mentions ongoing foreign investment outflows and the potential for further rupee depreciation, which could exacerbate fiscal pressures. While the RBI's foreign exchange reserves provide some buffer, the overall economic environment suggests increased fiscal strain. These factors collectively indicate a negative outlook for future fiscal deficit.",

Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in 1999 changed the Budget presentation to start at 11 am. Starting 2017, Arun Jaitley began presenting the Union Budget on February 1, departing from the colonial-era tradition of using the last working day.\n\nUntil 1955, the Union Budget was presented in English. However, the Congress-led government later decided to print the Budget papers in both Hindi and English. The Budget has since undergone many changes, with the 2021-22 edition making it paperless, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2019, Sitharaman became the second woman to have presented the budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71. That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a traditional 'bahi-khata' with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.\n\nTill 2017, the Budget for the Railways and Union Budget were presented separately. After being presented separately for 92 years, the Railway budget was merged in the Union Budget in 2017 and presented together.\n\nTill 1950, the budget was printed at Rashtrapati Bhavan till it got leaked and the venue of printing had to be shifted to a press at the Minto Road in New Delhi. In 1980, a government press was set up in the North Block - the seat of the finance ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nAhead of the Narendra Modi led-government's final full Budget presentation in their second term before the national polls in 2024, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is aiming for fiscal consolidation in what is going to be her fifth straight Budget announcement.Before the country's date with the Budget bahi-katha on February 1, here're some Budget trivia:India's first Budget was announced in pre-independent India, on April 7, 1860, when Scottish economist and politician James Wilson - of the East India Company - presented it to the British Crown.Post Independence, India's first budget was presented on November 26, 1947 by then Finance Minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.Four-time presenter Sitharaman holds the record for delivering the longest speech when she spoke for two hours and 42 minutes while presenting the 2020-21 Union Budget on February 1, 2020. With two pages still remaining, she had to cut her speech short.The previous record-holder? Also Sitharaman.

In 2019, Sitharaman became the second woman to have presented the budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the budget for the financial year 1970-71. That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a traditional 'bahi-khata' with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents. Till 2017, the Budget for the Railways and Union Budget were presented separately. After being presented separately for 92 years, the Railway budget was merged in the Union Budget in 2017 and presented together. Till 1950, the budget was printed at Rashtrapati Bhavan till it got leaked and the venue of printing had to be shifted to a press at the Minto Road in New Delhi.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article provides historical context and trivia about India's Union Budget but does not explicitly discuss future fiscal deficit projections or specific fiscal policies that would directly impact the deficit. However, it mentions that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is aiming for \"fiscal consolidation\" in the upcoming Budget. Fiscal consolidation typically implies measures to reduce the fiscal deficit, such as controlling spending or increasing revenue. This suggests a potential decrease in the fiscal deficit, though the article does not provide concrete details or projections. Given this hint, the future fiscal deficit direction appears somewhat positive, but the lack of specific information limits the strength of this indication.",

Firstly, the Indian government's fiscal deficit for 2023-24 was recorded at 5.6% of GDP, which is better than the earlier estimate of 5.8%. This indicates that the government is managing its finances more effectively than anticipated. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a record dividend of \u20b92.11 lakh crore to the central government for the financial year 2023\u201324, which is more than double the amount budgeted. This unexpected windfall enhances the government's cash balance and reduces the need for borrowing, thereby limiting bond supply and boosting bond prices. The article also mentions that the Indian economy grew by 8.2% in the fiscal year ending in March, which could lead to higher tax revenues and further improve the fiscal deficit. Overall, these factors suggest a gradual decrease in the fiscal deficit.",

He said the neighbouring country had been sending terrorists to India with nefarious designs and the Indian soldiers had been gunning down at least five-six of them every day. 08:52 Recently-appointed Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran is clear in his mind that the sprawling Tata Group has to be streamlined -- with several businesses needing to be consolidated, and others scaled up further. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Chandrasekaran said he has been busy collecting data, formulating strategy, building a team and laying out a capital allocation plan for the over $100 billion group. 08:48 To know what to expect in the market watch video here 08:47 A government audit of central universities has suggested that the words \u2018Muslim\u2019 and \u2018Hindu\u2019 be dropped from the names of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and Banaras Hindu University (BHU), respectively, to reflect their secular character, The Indian Express has learnt. The suggestion is contained in an audit of AMU by one of five committees set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) on April 25 at the behest of the HRD Ministry to probe complaints of irregularities against 10 central universities. 08:45 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray dared his party's ruling ally BJP to \"resign\" from the Maharashtra government and face midterm polls, reports PTI. The state's ruling partners are also part of the NDA at the Centre, but relations between them are strained for quite some time. \"I challenge you to resign from the government and face polls once again. We will show you the Shiv Sena's power. Even during the (Modi) wave, the BJP got votes in Sena's name,\" Thackeray said, addressing a rally for a local election in Nanded. 08:40 A report in the online news portal The Wire about the business dealings of BJP president Amit Shah\u2019s son Jay triggered a political storm Sunday, with the Congress asking whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would order an inquiry by the CBI or Enforcement Directorate, and the BJP calling the report \u201cfalse\u201d and defamatory\u201d, reports The Indian Express. Amit Shah\u2019s son said he would sue the author of the report and the editors and owners of the website for criminal defamation. \u201cWe finally found the only beneficiary of Demonetisation. It\u2019s not the RBI, the poor or the farmers. It\u2019s the Shah-in-Shah of Demo. Jai Amit,\u201d Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted. The CPI(M), AAP, Samajwadi Party and RJD too used the report to attack the BJP, Amit Shah and Modi. 08:31 Two days after seven military personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Tawang, purported images of their bodies being transferred in cardboard boxes surfaced on Sunday, triggering an outrage. India TV reports that this prompted the Army to come out with a tweet saying the wrapping of the bodies with local resources was an \u201caberration\u201d and that the fallen soldiers are always given full military honour. 08:22 Large protests were held across Australia on Saturday against Indian mining giant Adani Enterprises\u2019 proposed Carmichael coal mine, which would be the country\u2019s largest coal mine but has been delayed for years over environmental and financing issues. Environment groups say the mine in Queensland state would contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef. Reuters reports that the \u201cStop Adani\u201d movement organised 45 protests. 08:19 The Reserve Bank of India has initiated \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d against Oriental Bank of Commerce over its high amount of net non-performing assets (NPA), reports Reuters. Oriental Bank is the seventh state-run lender to be put under a corrective action plan, which requires a bank to enact curbs on hiring, branch expansion and taking on new loans. 08:10 The GST Council has introduced a slew of reforms amid the festive season to woo traders and consumers. In a big relief for exporters, it has decided to clear refunds for July and August in October via cheque. In the future, every exporter will get an e-wallet for refunds. The Council has also taken steps to ease compliance for businesses. It has decided to widen the composition scheme to taxpayers with turnover up to Rs 1 crore and allowed businesses with a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore to file returns quarterly. The rates for 27 items have been reduced -- khakhra, unbranded namkeen, unbranded Ayurvedic medicine and manmade yarn to attract lower taxes. A Group of Ministers has been appointed to look into the taxation regime for restaurants as well. Also, the Council has decided to look at implementing the e-way bill mechanism after April 1. 07:55 Gold prices rose on Monday, pulling further away from a two-month low, as fresh concerns over North Korea's nuclear ambitions stoked safe-haven demand for the precious metal and weighed on the dollar. 07:49 Business activity in China\u2019s services sector grew at its slowest pace in 21 months in September as the pace of new business cooled, a private survey showed. The survey was in sharp contrast to an official gauge of the non-manufacturing sector that showed the services sector expanded at the fastest clip since 2014 in September, blurring the picture on how a key part of the economy is performing, reports Reuters. The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) fell to 50.6 in September, the lowest reading since December 2012 and one of the weakest since the survey began in 2005. 07:46 Oil prices edged up on Monday, halting a 2% slide from Friday, on expectations that Saudi Arabia would continue to restrain its output in order to support prices, and as the amount of rigs drilling for new oil in the United States dipped. 07:45 British consumer spending jumped in September, but not by enough to halt a YoY decline that reflects rising living costs, a survey by payments company Visa showed. Consumer spending - adjusted for inflation and seasonal effects - rose by 1.4% in September after falling 0.4% MoM in August, Visa said, based on its credit and debit card data. Reuters reports that this was the biggest monthly rise since November, but still left overall spending in real terms 0.3% below its level a year ago. Spending has fallen YoY for four of the past five months, the longest series of such declines since April 2013. 07:41 British Prime Minister Theresa May has signalled that she could sack Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as she tries to reassert her authority after a series of political disasters, reports The Sunday Times. 07:38 Catalonia is expected to declare independence from Spain as early as Tuesday, reports CNBC. Following its banned referendum, Catalan president has said he prefers mediation out of the current crisis. But Dpain's central government has rejected this avenue demanding a \"return to the path of law\" before any talks. The likely outcome is that Catalonia will declare independence after a parliamentary session. 07:36 In Europe, stocks closed in the red on Friday as investors digested the latest set of payrolls data from the US and monitored political events in Spain. 07:34 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would be open to cutting a one- or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nation\u2019s healthcare system, a key campaign pledge made by Trump and the Republican Party. On Saturday, Trump told Reuters he had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what he called a \u201cgreat\u201d healthcare bill to replace Obamacare. 07:32 US President Donald Trump, who pledged to work with Democrats to protect \u201cDreamers\u201d - young people brought illegally to the United States as children - called on Sunday for money to fund a border wall and thousands more immigration officers to be part of any deal. Trump\u2019s list of immigration \u201cprinciples,\u201d laid out in a document seen by Reuters, was a non-starter for Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month. 07:21 Turkey's Lira has tumbled to an eight-month low against the dollar as relations with the US deteriorates. The Lira sank after the US blocked processing for the majority of new visas in Turkey, which in turn responded in kind, reports the The Financial Times. 07:17 CNBC reports that several Federal Reserve officials have indicated an openness to an interest rate hike in December. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said he was \"open minded\" about another rate hike by year-end, while New York Fed President William Dudley said he thought it was \"appropriate\" for the central bank to continue removing accommodation. 07:16 The Labour Department on Friday reported the first decline in US nonfarm payrolls in seven years, suggesting the economy took a hit from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. The US lost 33,000 jobs in September versus a forecast by economists of a gain of 90,000 jobs in a Reuters poll. Despite the weak headline number, average hourly earnings rose to an annualised rate of 2.9%. The unemployment rate also fell to a 16-year low of 4.2%. 07:11 US stocks closed mostly lower on Friday after weak jobs report: the first contraction in seven years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped its seven-day winning streak, while the S&P 500 snapped an eight-day winning streak - its longest in four years. However, the Nasdaq Composite outperformed, rising 0.07% at close. 07:07 It is a tepid start to trade in Asia ahead of key economic data in China. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan markets are closed for public holidays today. Investors are expected to turn their attention to China data as mainland markets resume trade after the week-long \"Golden Week\" holiday. The SGX Nifty is trading over 50 points lower at 9,970.5. 06:54 The rhetoric between North Korea and United States continued over the weekend. On Saturday, US President Donald Trump said \u201conly one thing will work\u201d in dealing with the isolated country. His comments seemed to suggest that military action was on his mind. Few hours later, Reuters reported that North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un said his nuclear weapons were a \u201cpowerful deterrent\u201d that guaranteed its sovereignty. In a meeting of the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party on Saturday, Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister, Kim Yo Jong, was made an alternate member of the politburo - the country\u2019s top decision-making body.",

Here\u2019s why\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, we are in the growth phase where valuations have expanded and now it is going to be the earnings growth which catches up. We will probably see some forward valuation compression but as long as the growth comes through, we are going to be in a longer growth phase for India ,\u201d says, Co-Head, Asian Economics , Strategy & Commodity Research,I am going to give you a kind of a two-pronged answer and be a two-headed economist here. There are really two important points to bring out. Number one is that if you look through financial history and tons of textbooks and studies, one of the most significant determinants of future returns is the price you pay at the start of your investing period.It is not surprising if you pay a high price. It is harder to have higher returns over time. It generally had a much better potential for return. Just purely from that, if the starting point for India is paying over 20 times earnings, then one should not expect as strong returns as we have enjoyed over five-year investing intervals. However, this is a really strong caveat to that. It looks like India would be able to deliver quite strong earnings growth because of the very favourable underlying fundamental dynamics.On top of that, we have written a detailed paper on this late last year. We are very excited about the theme or what you might call the increasing digitalisation of Indian equity markets. There are over 60 unicorns in the private sector that have been formed and those will be coming into the market through listing. As they come in, the configuration of the Indian index will start to shift and will take on more of this kind of digital economy structural growth components.That is something, which for example in China, was a terrific 10-year investment theme and a lot of wealth was created. We think a similar dynamic is taking place in India. Lastly, I would like to mention the outlook for a lot of other parts of the region and here there is a lot of concern about China. As for the high relative valuation for India, I do not think it will come down to where it has been over the past 10 years.So if you roll all this together, yes returns will be somewhat lower than we have enjoyed but I still think they are going to be good in absolute terms and India will be a good place to be investing in. The bottom line is if investors can see some sort of a price correction in India which will give a better entry point or we can wait for sometime to let the earnings catch up and let the multiples get naturally compressed, then it will be a very good time to re-engage in a more active manner in a positive Indian investment thesis.We have a similar way of kind of characterising the investment cycle and I would say right now, the growth phase. We have a lexicon which is despair, which is the bear market and then hope, which is you when the market rallies before the fundamentals change and we naturally get PE multiple expansion. Then we get the growth phase which is typically when multiples compress with the underlying earnings growth coming through and then the euphoria blowoff stage. After that, the whole cycle tends to repeat.Right now, we are in the growth phase where valuations have expanded and now it is going to be the earnings growth which catches up. We will probably see some forward valuation compression but as long as the growth comes through, we are going to be in a longer growth phase for India.This is a very important point and it is something for which credit goes to all the distributors, who are the attendees in this conference. It is really the life blood so to speak. And the point here is what we call the financialisation of Indian household savings.The concept is that Indian households save a lot. They have got a very strong, robust balance sheet but the majority of it is in property, cash and gold. Not that much of it is in financial assets. Our view is based upon looking at how various other economies have developed over time. There is going to be a development of financial market investment and there will be a structural shift in embracing of financial market investments by the Indian households.We think there is a long way to go in this because if you look at the current deployment, we are still well below 10% of the household balance sheet being invested either directly in equity markets or through mutual funds or other similar intermediaries. There is a very clear long-term structural trend of increasing share of financial assets in the household balance sheet which itself is going to grow as India\u2019s economic growth increases and peoples\u2019 wealth rises.So we think this is a really strong, fat, long-term trend which is quite positive and it underpins higher valuation for the Indian equity market. But the risk will be coming perhaps overly enthusiastic. I think the other kind of additional factor which we can look forward to and which could be a turbo charging factor on top of that domestic demand for equities, is the return of the foreign investors.For example, I am in New York right now. I have just had 30 conversations with US investors and the general take on India is yes, we like it but we had been overweight, it looks a bit expensive and we pulled back but we are looking to re-engage at some point. So $20 billion of net foreign selling gives foreign investors the opportunity to reload later.If they again become more enthusiastic, a combination of secular structural deployment of the Indian household balance sheet into the equity market could be complemented by a return of the foreign investors and that could give us some pretty handsome returns from Indian equities at some point down the line.This is true. So there are a few points that are important that we need to unpack. As you said, this is super top of mind. Just to deal with the recession question first. Of course, if the US goes into recession, that is not good for anyone. In relative terms, India will stand out as one of the more attractive places fundamentally because India is still enjoying sort of tailwind of recovery from the Covid induced setback. We are still trying to get back to the growth trajectory and that is indeed where we think the economy can grow over 8% this year.So there is obviously good potential trend growth but on top of that, there\u2019s a bit of catch up which we still have to enjoy and so India and other parts of Asia indeed standout in happy contrast to the risk of the US tipping back into recession because we have such a completely different kind of monetary and fiscal policy cycle as well as a growth dynamic which sets preference for parts of the world including India and away from the US.But that being said, if the US tips into recession, typically the equity market would sell off to some degree and we have noted that in the last 30 years, every time the US has gone down 10% or more, Asia will follow. It may follow to a lesser degree but it is going to be a depressing effect. It is true and that is something that domestic investors need to keep in mind.But the inversion is happening in what it is colloquially called the two-ten spread. The difference between the two-year yield and the 10-year yield and the reason why I mentioned this is that we need to be careful about what signal we are extracting from that inversion of the yield curve. The reason I mentioned this is because the 10-year yield has not risen as much as the two-year yield and which is why the curve is flat and then slightly inverted.The reason why 10 years are not higher than they should be from a fundamental perspective is because given more inflation in the US, from a global cross sectional perspective, the US yields look pretty attractive because German bonds are currently yielding 60 bps. Japanese JGBs are yielding 25 bps and the Bank of Japan just came out and said they want to keep those there for what is called yield curve control.My point here is that for the global pool of fixed income capital, which is in trillions of dollars, even if the US yield looks overvalued, relative to elsewhere it looks great. So what it is doing is that it is artificially suppressing demand-supply reasons the 10 years or so. Where I am getting with this is that the signal is distorted by technical flow of funds issue and may not be giving us as clear an indication of actual economic recession risk as it typically does in other circumstances.We have got various models that look at these circumstances economically.I actually have a lot of sympathy for that view and this gets back to the kind of longer term, the comments I was making before about the change within the Indian stock market and economy. The greater embracing of the digital economy and living and breathing it actually means a lot of positive potential. The digitisation process and India\u2019s stack of Aadhaar, the biometric identification; the capability of doing banking, digital KYC capabilities and of course the universal payment interface (UPI) which allows for cashless transactions, the combination of all this releases great potential.The analogy here is with the construction of the US highway system in the 1950s, which had tremendous ripple effects. It was sort of a common social good that was put in place but that connecting US by that highway system engendered a huge productivity and growth spur. The analogy here is that a digital highway has been put in place. It is a common good and it is enabling the rapid formation of companies on top of that.It also includes the vast majority of the India population which previously was in the informal or the grey economy and the potential here is however strong India\u2019s growth could be, that digital good and investment which has been made, could boost India\u2019s growth rate even further. We do not know what that is. It could be one percentage point or more or less, but it certainly is a positive and is that starts getting explored more significantly, that could lead to a structurally higher growth and better earnings.That could give us a much better longer term Indian investment story. We are onboard to that longer term picture. But right now, with the current entry price getting back to the previous question, we are a little bit less enthusiastic. We are still buyers on a pullback. The longer term structural story should be positive and that is how we square the circle on that.",

After that, the whole cycle tends to repeat.Right now, we are in the growth phase where valuations have expanded and now it is going to be the earnings growth which catches up. We will probably see some forward valuation compression but as long as the growth comes through, we are going to be in a longer growth phase for India.This is a very important point and it is something for which credit goes to all the distributors, who are the attendees in this conference. It is really the life blood so to speak. And the point here is what we call the financialisation of Indian household savings.The concept is that Indian households save a lot. They have got a very strong, robust balance sheet but the majority of it is in property, cash and gold. Not that much of it is in financial assets. Our view is based upon looking at how various other economies have developed over time. There is going to be a development of financial market investment and there will be a structural shift in embracing of financial market investments by the Indian households.We think there is a long way to go in this because if you look at the current deployment, we are still well below 10% of the household balance sheet being invested either directly in equity markets or through mutual funds or other similar intermediaries. There is a very clear long-term structural trend of increasing share of financial assets in the household balance sheet which itself is going to grow as India\u2019s economic growth increases and peoples\u2019 wealth rises.So we think this is a really strong, fat, long-term trend which is quite positive and it underpins higher valuation for the Indian equity market. But the risk will be coming perhaps overly enthusiastic. I think the other kind of additional factor which we can look forward to and which could be a turbo charging factor on top of that domestic demand for equities, is the return of the foreign investors.For example, I am in New York right now. I have just had 30 conversations with US investors and the general take on India is yes, we like it but we had been overweight, it looks a bit expensive and we pulled back but we are looking to re-engage at some point. So $20 billion of net foreign selling gives foreign investors the opportunity to reload later.If they again become more enthusiastic, a combination of secular structural deployment of the Indian household balance sheet into the equity market could be complemented by a return of the foreign investors and that could give us some pretty handsome returns from Indian equities at some point down the line.This is true. So there are a few points that are important that we need to unpack. As you said, this is super top of mind. Just to deal with the recession question first. Of course, if the US goes into recession, that is not good for anyone. In relative terms, India will stand out as one of the more attractive places fundamentally because India is still enjoying sort of tailwind of recovery from the Covid induced setback. We are still trying to get back to the growth trajectory and that is indeed where we think the economy can grow over 8% this year.So there is obviously good potential trend growth but on top of that, there\u2019s a bit of catch up which we still have to enjoy and so India and other parts of Asia indeed standout in happy contrast to the risk of the US tipping back into recession because we have such a completely different kind of monetary and fiscal policy cycle as well as a growth dynamic which sets preference for parts of the world including India and away from the US.But that being said, if the US tips into recession, typically the equity market would sell off to some degree and we have noted that in the last 30 years, every time the US has gone down 10% or more, Asia will follow. It may follow to a lesser degree but it is going to be a depressing effect. It is true and that is something that domestic investors need to keep in mind.But the inversion is happening in what it is colloquially called the two-ten spread. The difference between the two-year yield and the 10-year yield and the reason why I mentioned this is that we need to be careful about what signal we are extracting from that inversion of the yield curve. The reason I mentioned this is because the 10-year yield has not risen as much as the two-year yield and which is why the curve is flat and then slightly inverted.The reason why 10 years are not higher than they should be from a fundamental perspective is because given more inflation in the US, from a global cross sectional perspective, the US yields look pretty attractive because German bonds are currently yielding 60 bps. Japanese JGBs are yielding 25 bps and the Bank of Japan just came out and said they want to keep those there for what is called yield curve control.My point here is that for the global pool of fixed income capital, which is in trillions of dollars, even if the US yield looks overvalued, relative to elsewhere it looks great. So what it is doing is that it is artificially suppressing demand-supply reasons the 10 years or so. Where I am getting with this is that the signal is distorted by technical flow of funds issue and may not be giving us as clear an indication of actual economic recession risk as it typically does in other circumstances.We have got various models that look at these circumstances economically.I actually have a lot of sympathy for that view and this gets back to the kind of longer term, the comments I was making before about the change within the Indian stock market and economy. The greater embracing of the digital economy and living and breathing it actually means a lot of positive potential. The digitisation process and India\u2019s stack of Aadhaar, the biometric identification; the capability of doing banking, digital KYC capabilities and of course the universal payment interface (UPI) which allows for cashless transactions, the combination of all this releases great potential.The analogy here is with the construction of the US highway system in the 1950s, which had tremendous ripple effects. It was sort of a common social good that was put in place but that connecting US by that highway system engendered a huge productivity and growth spur. The analogy here is that a digital highway has been put in place. It is a common good and it is enabling the rapid formation of companies on top of that.It also includes the vast majority of the India population which previously was in the informal or the grey economy and the potential here is however strong India\u2019s growth could be, that digital good and investment which has been made, could boost India\u2019s growth rate even further. We do not know what that is. It could be one percentage point or more or less, but it certainly is a positive and is that starts getting explored more significantly, that could lead to a structurally higher growth and better earnings.That could give us a much better longer term Indian investment story. We are onboard to that longer term picture. But right now, with the current entry price getting back to the previous question, we are a little bit less enthusiastic. We are still buyers on a pullback. The longer term structural story should be positive and that is how we square the circle on that.",

    "full_article": "S&P Global Ratings on Thursday said the Indian economy will shrink by 5 per cent in the current fiscal as it joined a chorus of international agencies that are forecasting a contraction in growth rate due to coronavirus lockdown halting economic activity. Stating that COVID-19 has not yet been contained in India, the rating agency in a statement said the government stimulus package is low relative to countries with similar economic impacts from the pandemic.\n\n\"The COVID-19 outbreak in India and two months of lockdown -- longer in some areas -- have led to a sudden stop in the economy. That means growth will contract sharply this fiscal year (April 2020 to March 2021),\" it said. \"Economic activity will face ongoing disruption over the next year as the country transitions to a post-COVID-19 world.\" Forecasting a 5 per cent contraction in 2020-21 (versus 1.8 per cent growth forecast it made in April), S&P said growth is expected to pick up to 8.5 per cent in the following fiscal (up from the previous forecast of 7.5 per cent). The GDP is projected to expand by 6.5 per cent in FY23 and 6.6 per cent FY24.\n\nAlso read: Coronavirus effect: India's fourth, 'perhaps worst' recession is here, warns CRISIL\n\nEarlier this week, Fitch Ratings and Crisil, too, projected a 5 per cent contraction for the Indian economy. While Fitch Ratings had stated that India has had a very stringent lockdown policy that has lasted a lot longer than initially expected and incoming economic activity data have been spectacularly weak, Crisil had said the country's fourth recession since Independence, first since liberalisation, and perhaps the worst to date, is here.\n\nOn Thursday, Fitch Solutions (which is separate from Fitch Ratings) forecast real GDP to contract by 4.5 per cent in FY2020-21 saying \"high unemployment will depress consumer spending, while widespread economic uncertainties will curb investment in the private sector. Moody's Investors Service on May 8, forecast a 'zero' growth rate for India in FY21. In the past 69 years, India has seen a recession only thrice - as per available data - in fiscal year 1958, 1966 and 1980. A monsoon shock that hit agriculture, then a sizeable part of the economy, was the reason on all three occasions.\n\nAlso read: Coronavirus impact: Indian economy to contract 5% in FY21, says Fitch Ratings\n\nThis time around agriculture is not the reason but a dent to industrial and economic activity caused by lockdown, which was first imposed on March 25. The lockdown has been extended thrice till May 31 with some easing of restrictions. S&P Global Ratings expects varying degrees of containment measures and economic resumption across India during this transition.\n\n\"COVID-19 has not yet been contained in India. New cases have been averaging more than 6,000 a day over the past week as authorities begin easing stringent lockdown restrictions gradually to prevent economic costs from blowing out further. We currently assume that the outbreak peaks by the third quarter,\" it said. India has grouped geographical zones into red, orange, or green categories based on the number of cases. Areas currently classified as red zones are also economically significant, and the authorities could extend mobility restrictions.\n\n\"We believe economic activity in these places will take longer to normalize. This will have knock-on impacts on countrywide supply chains, which will slow the overall recovery,\" it said. The rating agency said high-frequency data for April showed major economic costs for India - purchasing managers index (PMI) for the services sector was 5.4, on a scale where anything below 50 indicates a contraction of business activity from the previous month for the sector.\n\nAlso read: Coronavirus impact: State's fiscal deficit to rise to 4.5% of GDP in FY21, says Ind-Ra\n\nAlso, service sectors, which account for high shares of employment, have been severely affected, thus leading to large-scale job losses across the country. Workers have been geographically displaced as migrant workers travelled back home before the lockdown, and this will take time to unwind as lockdown measures are lifted. \"We expect that employment will remain depressed over the transition period,\" it said.\n\nS&P said India has limited room to maneuver on policy support. The Reserve Bank of India has cut policy rates by 115 basis points but banks have been unwilling to extend credit. Small and mid-size enterprises continue to face restricted access to credit markets despite some policy measures aimed at easing financing for the sector. \"The government's stimulus package, with a headline amount of 10 per cent of GDP, has about 1.2 per cent of direct stimulus measures, which is low relative to countries with similar economic impacts from the pandemic. The remaining 8.8 per cent of the package includes liquidity support measures and credit guarantees that will not directly support growth,\" it said.\n\nThe rating agency said the big hit to growth will mean a large, permanent economic loss and a deterioration in balance sheets throughout the economy. \"The risks around the path of recovery will depend on three key factors. First, the speed with which the COVID-19 outbreak comes under control. Faster flattening of the curve -- in other words, reducing the number of new cases -- will potentially allow faster normalization of activity. Second, a labour market recovery will be key to getting the economy running again. Finally, the ability of all sectors of the economy to restore their balance sheets following the adverse shock will be important. The longer the duration of the shock, the longer recovery,\" it added.\n\nAcknowledging a high degree of uncertainty about the rate of spread and peak of the coronavirus outbreak, it said some government authorities estimate the pandemic will peak around mid-year, and that has been used as an assumption in assessing the economic and credit implications.\n\nAlso read: Coronavirus India Live Updates: Rajasthan records 131 new COVID-19 cases, state's tally at 7,947",
    "cleaned_article": "S&P Global Ratings on Thursday said the Indian economy will shrink by 5 per cent in the current fiscal as it joined a chorus of international agencies that are forecasting a contraction in growth rate due to coronavirus lockdown halting economic activity. Stating that COVID-19 has not yet been contained in India, the rating agency in a statement said the government stimulus package is low relative to countries with similar economic impacts from the pandemic. \"The COVID-19 outbreak in India and two months of lockdown -- longer in some areas -- have led to a sudden stop in the economy. That means growth will contract sharply this fiscal year (April 2020 to March 2021),\" it said. \"Economic activity will face ongoing disruption over the next year as the country transitions to a post-COVID-19 world.\" Forecasting a 5 per cent contraction in 2020-21 (versus 1.8 per cent growth forecast it made in April), S&P said growth is expected to pick up to 8.5 per cent in the following fiscal (up from the previous forecast of 7.5 per cent). The GDP is projected to expand by 6.5 per cent in FY23 and 6.6 per cent FY24. Also read: Coronavirus effect: India's fourth, 'perhaps worst' recession is here, warns CRISIL Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings and Crisil, too, projected a 5 per cent contraction for the Indian economy. While Fitch Ratings had stated that India has had a very stringent lockdown policy that has lasted a lot longer than initially expected and incoming economic activity data have been spectacularly weak, Crisil had said the country's fourth recession since Independence, first since liberalisation, and perhaps the worst to date, is here. On Thursday, Fitch Solutions (which is separate from Fitch Ratings) forecast real GDP to contract by 4.5 per cent in FY2020-21 saying \"high unemployment will depress consumer spending, while widespread economic uncertainties will curb investment in the private sector. Moody's Investors Service on May 8, forecast a 'zero' growth rate for India in FY21. In the past 69 years, India has seen a recession only thrice - as per available data - in fiscal year 1958, 1966 and 1980. A monsoon shock that hit agriculture, then a sizeable part of the economy, was the reason on all three occasions. Also read: Coronavirus impact: Indian economy to contract 5% in FY21, says Fitch Ratings This time around agriculture is not the reason but a dent to industrial and economic activity caused by lockdown, which was first imposed on March 25. The lockdown has been extended thrice till May 31 with some easing of restrictions. S&P Global Ratings expects varying degrees of containment measures and economic resumption across India during this transition. \"COVID-19 has not yet been contained in India.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the Indian economy will contract by 5% in the current fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and prolonged lockdown measures. This economic contraction is likely to lead to reduced tax revenues, which could exacerbate the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the government's stimulus package is described as relatively low compared to other countries with similar economic impacts, implying limited fiscal support to counteract the economic downturn. The article also highlights ongoing economic disruption, high unemployment, and slow recovery in key sectors, which will further strain government finances. While there is no explicit mention of future fiscal deficit levels, the combination of reduced economic activity, limited fiscal stimulus, and prolonged recovery suggests that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase in the near future.",

The world is back, but India\u2019s consumption has held us up, said, Chairman,to ET Now. Edited excerpts:I think it is again unmodellable. The stock market represents the formal economy and the formal economy does not represent the real economy and that is a pre-existing condition. So the second wave is a little more unmodellable than the first one, not because of the national lockdown. I mean thankfully we did not go for the one-size-fits-all lockdown. People may think that was why this virus spread, but I think we have to look at the situation from a variant perspective.The challenge is \u2018umeed pe duniya chalti hai, umeed pe duniya kayam hai\u2019 as they said in Kashmir where I grew up. And you cannot plan dinner. You cannot plan a trip. You cannot plan a factory and at some point, that is starting to impact the mood here right now. Now obviously, all this depends on the vaccination. If we get to 40-50% vaccination, the economic scarring or what economists call hysteresis will not show up. But 14 months after the first wave, India has resisted what labour market economists call hysteresis. But I think if this vaccination does not get an overdrive, we have to be a little careful.I am hoping that in the next three to six months, the vaccination can get fully on overdrive and then you will not have domestic consumption and demand holding up the economy. The world is back, but India\u2019s consumption has held us up. That will start getting impacted if we do not get the vaccine to the levels that we need.There were two unintended consequences of the first wave, people cut costs a lot. In fact, they cut it more than they should have. So, when the economy came back, they were struggling. But when they cut those costs, they realised that they were bloated in the middle. The pyramid had become a cylinder and now they are going back to being an Eiffel Tower. But the Eiffel Tower means a very broad base and so who they are recruiting and the noises that you are hearing are at the bottom of the pyramid.Obviously younger people are cheaper than older people, and sales customer service, logistics also tends to be skewed towards younger people. So yes, you are seeing a comeback at the bottom of the pyramid hiring primarily because COVID has been a great revealer of pre-existing conditions and a great accelerator of trends like digitisation, e-commerce and many other areas. Logistics, sales, customer service which anyway are the three pillars that have held up the Indian economy in the last few years have really been accelerated by COVID.I think that there is a light at the end of the tunnel for kids at the bottom of the pyramid willing to work in these areas. Obviously, I will keep saying that if we do not get the vaccination to the point that is critical mass, whether that 30-40% of the population, we are today only at 15% of the population. We need to get to 40-50% vaccination otherwise the \u2018umeed pe duniya kayam hai\u2019 is always a challenge. It is like what Keynes called animal spirits. He was clear that throwing more labour, land, capital at the economy does not help if the mood is not fine. The global mood has come back so quickly in China, the US and other places. I think India was ready for that, but vaccination will be a big binary outcome on whether we go back to the pre-March 2020 levels of consumption, hiring, investment and everything else.The mandatory global digital literacy program which the lockdown has enforced on all age groups, all castes, all religions, and all countries is really an important part of the productivity super cycle that digitisation is driving. Now obviously, the leading indicators were the Indian IT services companies because there is no such thing as a technology company. Every company is a technology company, so you will see IT employment go from four million to 10 million probably in the next five years.More importantly, India was always a laggard in what economists call total factor productivity but we did not have a Y2K problem because we skipped the learning. This digitisation super cycle for India will accelerate productivity. And digital literacy is a vocational skill, it is like English. People think English is a language, but English is a vocational skill in a country like India with 29 languages. The net impact of Covid on the digitisation super cycle will create barbell jobs. It will create jobs at the bottom in sales, customer service and delivery and obviously you will create a massive number of jobs at the top end because technology is no longer the preserve of technology companies. Every company is a technology company.Overall Covid has reminded people that you cannot build capacity for peak load handling, you need to variablise your costs. I mean companies are rivers, they are not ponds and shareholders do not pay salaries, customers do. So, I think Covid has been a hearing aid for employers or an accelerant of the deconstruction of organisations. Organisations thought about permanent staff, but now they think about permanent staff, they think about third party contracts, they think about direct contracts, they think about consultants.The complexity of people supply chains is really increasing and that overall is positive for staffing because employment has shifted from being a lifetime contract to a taxi cab relationship. Covid has accelerated that association of employment with offices and an employer. Work and employment are now diverging and so for staffing we are already back to where we were in March last year.The trend will only accelerate structurally from this point. But obviously based on vaccination, based on the weather of the moment. I mean Covid is a passing storm, it is not climate change. But as of now, to all of us in the middle of the storm we have to be careful that vaccination is put on priority. I cannot emphasise that you know because confidence is a mind game and we have now decided, or employers and employees both have decided that vaccination will be the biggest rocket of this mind game.India should technically see no wage inflation. I mean, we have 200 million people sitting on farms or sitting in the informal sectors, if you think about the Lewisian turning point our wages should not have gone up. China wages did not go up between 1978 to 1998 till they joined WTO even though they moved 200 million people. I think whether at the moment, given that we will end the crisis with public debt at 90% of GDP \u2013 it has been 70% of GDP for the last 20 years \u2013 RBI\u2019s balance sheet is substantially expanded. That fiscal and monetary policy has limited firepower. Of course, this is a once in a multi decade emergency, so we will stretch everything we can as a country.But wage inflation will not show up in the short run, but in the long run structural reform will have to be accelerated. We saw some of that in labour, we saw some of that in farms, but we have to figure out how to make India a fertile habitat for job creation. Otherwise the scarring that Covid will leave on peoples\u2019 psyche will be a labour market hysteresis. In the short run there is enough supply of labour. We cannot take jobs to people, we have to take people to jobs.Migrants have come back and more migrants will come because not only were they not welcomed at home, they realised that they were not running to cities, they were running away from economic wastelands. So actually, migration is turning out to be another reason why wage inflation will be held down because if you think cities are hurting, rural areas are hurting even more economically.",

However, there is no explicit discussion of future government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or significant fiscal policy changes that would directly impact the fiscal deficit. The focus on inflation control and CAD narrowing indicates a stable macroeconomic environment, but this does not provide a clear prediction about the future direction of the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the article is neutral regarding future fiscal deficit trends.",

While the central government has been reducing its fiscal deficit, the states have been increasing theirs, leading to a slight worsening of the aggregate fiscal deficit over the past few years. Raghuram Rajan explicitly mentions this as a worry, indicating that the overall fiscal deficit is not improving and may even be deteriorating. Additionally, the article discusses the government's push for leniency from the RBI, including easing NPA norms and transferring more dividends to boost liquidity, which could imply increased spending or reduced financial discipline. These factors suggest a potential increase in the fiscal deficit in the future, or at least a failure to reduce it significantly.  \n\n**",

On one hand, the IMF projects robust economic growth for India, which could support higher tax revenues and potentially reduce the fiscal deficit. The IMF also supports the government's infrastructure spending plans, which are crucial for medium-term growth and could have positive long-term fiscal implications. Additionally, the IMF emphasizes the need for fiscal policy to prioritize medium-term consolidation, anchored on strong revenue mobilization and expenditure efficiency, which suggests a focus on reducing the deficit over time.\n\nHowever, the article also highlights significant risks, including a potential sharper-than-anticipated global slowdown, unresolved war in Ukraine, and rising domestic inflation. These factors could dampen economic growth, reduce tax revenues, and increase government spending on social support programs, thereby exerting upward pressure on the fiscal deficit. The IMF also notes the need for additional support for vulnerable groups, which could imply increased government spending in the short term.\n\nOverall, while there are positive signals regarding fiscal consolidation",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article discusses the Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) recommendation to extend the Emergency Loan Credit Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) to stressed sectors like hospitality, tourism, aviation, and retail. While the CII emphasizes that this intervention would not impact the fiscal deficit this year, it highlights the government's existing revenue constraints and the widening fiscal deficit. The proposal suggests utilizing unutilized funds from the ECLGS and potentially adding Rs 50,000 crore to support these sectors. Although the scheme is framed as a \"win-win\" with no immediate fiscal strain, the broader context of fiscal constraints and the need for additional support implies potential pressure on future fiscal deficits. The article does not explicitly predict an increase in the fiscal deficit, but the combination of revenue constraints, ongoing economic recovery challenges, and the possibility of additional spending hints at a risk of future fiscal deficit expansion.  \n\n**",

Here\u2019s a lowdown on nine macro triggers that are likely to impact the market on Friday. This report was compiled from agency feeds. Demonetisation has come at a cost to the government. The Reserve Bank of India will transfer only Rs 30,659 crore to the government, less than half the amount- Rs 65876 crore it transferred to last year. The reduction in the transfer of surplus to the government could be due to a number of factors including higher cost of printing new currency notes and cost of managing excess liquidity generated phasing out of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, though it is difficult to identify exact reasons at this stage. The lower amount will mean government\u2019s non-tax receipts will be affected and that could impact fiscal deficit numbers. As the saying goes, a good deed seldom goes unpunished!The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday stayed a 7 August Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) directive against J. Kumar Infraprojects Ltd and Prakash Industries Ltd labelling them suspected shell companies. Stock exchanges will now have to lift trading restrictions on these companies and allow regular trading of their shares. J Kumar and Prakash Industries shares will resume trading on Friday, BSE said in a late evening notice. Three companies\u2014J. Kumar, Prakash Industries and Parsvnath Developers Ltd\u2014on Wednesday approached the tribunal against their inclusion in a list of 331 suspected shell firms. The plea by Parsvnath will be heard on Friday.Activity in the job market is probably picking up, with big recruitment firms witnessing a more than 10% increase in July hiring compared with a year earlier. Sectors that are driving hiring include banking and financial services, ecommerce, consumer goods and telecom. Manufacturing, IT and industrial services, which were subdued on the jobs front, are also likely to look up in the next few months, according to executives from recruitment firms such as ABC Consultants, Monster, TeamLease, Quess and Randstad India.Banks with operations in India witnessed a significant rise in non-performing assets during the first half of 2017. The Ficci-IBA survey carried out for January-June revealed that NPAs in public sector banks shot up considerably, with 91% respondents from public sector banks reporting an increase. Twenty public, private and foreign banks participated in the survey, which together represent 64% of the banking industry as classified by asset size. Meanwhile, 71% private and 50% foreign bank respondents stated that their bad loans have increased during January-June.The Rajya Sabha gave its assent to the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2017 to give more powers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with bad loans. The Bill, which was cleared last week by the Lok Sabha, replaces an ordinance promulgated in May to allow the RBI to quickly start the resolution process. After the promulgation of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, the RBI identified 12 companies, which account for a quarter of the total non-performing assets at banks, for immediate referral for resolution under the bankruptcy law.The government expects the goods and services tax (GST) and increased surveillance to boost tax revenues over the next two years, taking India\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio close to 12% by FY20. The higher revenues are projected to push up capital spend of the government, bring down fiscal deficit to sustainable 3% of GDP and lower the revenue deficit to 1.4% of GDP by FY20. The medium-term expenditure framework released by the government on Thursday shows tax-to-GDP ratio rising 30 basis points each in FY19 and FY20 to 11.6% and 11.9% respectively.

    "cleaned_article": "The US-North Korea face-off has been roiling the global markets including the Indian market. Here\u2019s a lowdown on nine macro triggers that are likely to impact the market on Friday. This report was compiled from agency feeds. Demonetisation has come at a cost to the government. The Reserve Bank of India will transfer only Rs 30,659 crore to the government, less than half the amount- Rs 65876 crore it transferred to last year. The reduction in the transfer of surplus to the government could be due to a number of factors including higher cost of printing new currency notes and cost of managing excess liquidity generated phasing out of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, though it is difficult to identify exact reasons at this stage. The lower amount will mean government\u2019s non-tax receipts will be affected and that could impact fiscal deficit numbers. As the saying goes, a good deed seldom goes unpunished!The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday stayed a 7 August Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) directive against J. Kumar Infraprojects Ltd and Prakash Industries Ltd labelling them suspected shell companies. Stock exchanges will now have to lift trading restrictions on these companies and allow regular trading of their shares. J Kumar and Prakash Industries shares will resume trading on Friday, BSE said in a late evening notice. Three companies\u2014J. Kumar, Prakash Industries and Parsvnath Developers Ltd\u2014on Wednesday approached the tribunal against their inclusion in a list of 331 suspected shell firms. The plea by Parsvnath will be heard on Friday.Activity in the job market is probably picking up, with big recruitment firms witnessing a more than 10% increase in July hiring compared with a year earlier. Sectors that are driving hiring include banking and financial services, ecommerce, consumer goods and telecom. Manufacturing, IT and industrial services, which were subdued on the jobs front, are also likely to look up in the next few months, according to executives from recruitment firms such as ABC Consultants, Monster, TeamLease, Quess and Randstad India.Banks with operations in India witnessed a significant rise in non-performing assets during the first half of 2017. The Ficci-IBA survey carried out for January-June revealed that NPAs in public sector banks shot up considerably, with 91% respondents from public sector banks reporting an increase. Twenty public, private and foreign banks participated in the survey, which together represent 64% of the banking industry as classified by asset size. Meanwhile, 71% private and 50% foreign bank respondents stated that their bad loans have increased during January-June.The Rajya Sabha gave its assent to the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2017 to give more powers to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal with bad loans. The Bill, which was cleared last week by the Lok Sabha, replaces an ordinance promulgated in May to allow the RBI to quickly start the resolution process. After the promulgation of the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, the RBI identified 12 companies, which account for a quarter of the total non-performing assets at banks, for immediate referral for resolution under the bankruptcy law.The government expects the goods and services tax (GST) and increased surveillance to boost tax revenues over the next two years, taking India\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio close to 12% by FY20. The higher revenues are projected to push up capital spend of the government, bring down fiscal deficit to sustainable 3% of GDP and lower the revenue deficit to 1.4% of GDP by FY20. The medium-term expenditure framework released by the government on Thursday shows tax-to-GDP ratio rising 30 basis points each in FY19 and FY20 to 11.6% and 11.9% respectively.

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: ANALYSIS: The article provides mixed signals about the future fiscal deficit. On the negative side, it mentions that the Reserve Bank of India will transfer significantly less surplus to the government compared to the previous year, which will impact non-tax receipts and could worsen the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) in banks could strain the financial system and potentially increase government liabilities. On the positive side, the government expects the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and increased surveillance to boost tax revenues over the next two years, which could help reduce the fiscal deficit to a sustainable 3% of GDP by FY20. The medium-term expenditure framework also projects a gradual increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio, which supports deficit reduction. However, the article does not provide a definitive prediction, and the positive factors are somewhat offset by the negative ones. Overall, the future fiscal deficit direction remains uncertain, leaning slightly toward improvement due to the expected tax revenue boost.\n\nSCORE:",

This is the biggest one-day vault against the American currency in seven weeks. After a seemingly endless stream of gloomy news and falling values, sentiment has finally started to show signs of improvement globally against the backdrop of the upcoming visit of Chinese delegates to the US in order to re-engage in trade talks. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Easing contagion risk on emerging market currencies after last week's carnage also led to a positive influence on the trading front. The recovery also coincides with the falling inflation levels despite widening trade deficit, which has risen to a near five-year high. The Indian currency had its most turbulent week in more than two years witnessing record lows after doing little to quell investors' fears of a prolonged downturn ahead -- a shock resembling 2013 currency crisis. The rupee crashed to a historic low of 70.40 before closing at a life-time low of 70.15 against the dollar in the wake of Turkey's currency crisis last week. However, the upside was cushioned by hardening worries over fiscal slippage after the country's trade gap widened to a five-year high amid rising global crude prices. The domestic currency touched a high of 69.59 in early deals. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Staging a smart recovery, the rupee opened with a gap up at 69.83 against last Thursday's close of 70.15 at the inter-bank foreign exchange (forex) market. The fresh breakout pushed the rupee to hit a session's high of 69.59 as foreign banks sold the greenback. A strong rally in local equities further added momentum. Easing trade tensions between the US and China also boosted most Asian currencies. After revisiting a high of 69.59, the local unit finally ended the day at 69.82, revealing a sharp rise of 33 paise, or 0.47 per cent. The Financial Benchmarks India private limited (FBIL), meanwhile, fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 69.7617 and for the euro at 79.6720. The 10-year benchmark bond yield also eased to 7.84 per cent. On the energy front, benchmark Brent oil stabilised near USD 72 per barrel on Monday after several weeks of decline, weighed down by concerns over slowing global economic growth but supported by an expected fall in supply from Iran due to US sanctions. Meanwhile, country's forex reserves have declined by USD 25.147 billion between April 13 and August 10, with the rupee on a downward spiral since the beginning of the year forcing the Reserve Bank to sell dollars to defend the local currency. The forex reserves plunged to a low of USD 400.88 billion in the week to August 10, losing a whopping USD 1.822 billion within a week, according to the latest to RBI data. Foreign investors, however, pumped in over Rs 8,500 crore into the Indian capital markets following weakening crude oil prices and better corporate earnings. Globally, the US dollar rebounded after a brief sell-off in anticipation of the US-China trade talks. Against a basket of other currencies, the dollar index is up at 96.1. In the cross currency trade, the rupee bounced back against the euro to finish at 79.72 compared to 79.80 and also recovered against the Japanese yen to end at 63.15 per 100 yens from 63.28 earlier. The home unit remained firm against the British pound and settled at 89.11 per pound from 89.12. Elsewhere, the euro retreated from early highs against the US dollar due to growing concerns over Italy's potential massive 80 billion euro budget spending to upgrade the country's infrastructure as fallout from last week's collapse of Genoa bridge is exerting both a political and economic cost. The British pound traded little changed against the greenback amid growing worries about a no-deal Brexit been weighing on Sterling for some time. In forward market today, premium for dollar declined owing to mild receiving from exporters. The benchmark six-month forward premium payable in December edged down to 106-108 paise from 107-109 paise and the far-forward June 2019 contract softened to 253-255 paise from 254.50-256.50 paise.",

Once the yield curve starts to flatten and even inverse and bond yields are all consistent with worries about recession. I suspect the US economy is going to slow very sharply in 2019 but I doubt we are going to have a recession. Therefore, this selling pressure on equities globally will subside relatively quickly because the market is pricing in a fairly negative scenario now.I would certainly say they are a better investment. A lot of people have the view that because emerging markets did not sell off as much in the fourth quarter as the US and other developed markets did, the emerging markets are ready to go down. I think you got to look at 2018 as a whole and EMs had a very bad year. We started to selloff way back at the end of January. You have seen some widening of the valuation discount that EMs is trading on versus the developed markets. You have started to see in some places, slightly more optimistic outlooks for the economy.On the emerging markets side, the biggest worry is probably the speed of the Chinese slowdown. We will see two important data points this year; one was the PMI data for China at the beginning of the year and then of course, we had the revenue warning. The biggest risk for markets now is if we get a more severe slowdown in the Chinese economy than perhaps everyone has been expecting.A sharper slowdown would not be good. You are going to get gradual slowdown rather than a sharp slowdown. If my view is correct, then emerging markets may form a base before too long sometime in the first quarter and have a better recovery and have a better period of time after that.India is probably going to underperform or is not going to outperform, India has held up very well in the fourth quarter and you have got the elections coming out. Plus you have the fiscal risk in India. The scenario here is no US recession, no major Chinese collapse and markets start to bottom out, EM beats DM in 2019. We start to see the EM beginning to recover sometime in Q1 and India in that environment probably underperforms.As I said, emerging market equities will outperform developed market equities although I do think that the US market is probably close to the bottom as well. The issues that you mentioned about Brexit for example and of course, Europe had a terrible last year. Europe has got tremendous growth challenges and the Brexit story is still there. No one knows how that is going to play itself out and of course, not only is the Italian government fighting with the commission over their budget deficit numbers, and so maybe, the French government as well.I am very sceptical about Europe but I think US is probably not far from the low point. But I prefer emerging market equities and I think some of the gains you have seen recently in places like Latin America and parts of Europe, are probably going to lead the way, taking 2019 as a whole until we have a better sense of where China is going.If China really starts to settle down in terms of the economy and slowdown begins to ease, Asian shares will eventually have some sort of recovery but right now, the risks to the global economy are from the US economy, China and therefore, certainly from the trade war between the US and China.The dollar is overpriced and it is going to come down and of course, traditionally that is very helpful for emerging markets. I would expect to see the dollar going lower. In case of treasury yields, even if we do not have a recession in the US economy, they are probably close to their bottom and it is going to take some time for those yields to back up again.Also, we are very close to the Fed actually stopping their tightening campaign which is probably very likely so that you might see bond yields go a bit lower.

This increase is attributed to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to higher market borrowings and increased pressure on state governments to provide fiscal stimulus measures. The article also mentions a worsening revenue balance and higher revenue deficits, further supporting the expectation of a larger fiscal deficit. The relaxation of borrowing limits, while providing some fiscal space, is conditional and linked to reform achievements, which may not fully offset the deficit increase.

It is currently trading at 68.08, depreciating one per cent in less than a week.

Some experts do not rule out the rupee to weaken further to a new low to the psychologically key Rs 70 per dollar.\n\nAccording to The Hindu, the behaviour of the exchange rate in May 2018 has been eerily similar to that in May 2013, the month that marked the onset of the 'taper tantrum' - when hints from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it was planning to taper its bond-buying programme saw the rupee slide by over 20 per cent against the dollar in three months till August. That was the time India was in the midst of its worst economic crisis since 1991, and the government intervened to buffer the rupee by introducing capital controls, restrictions on non-essential imports, and interest rate hikes. Though the report adds that the situation is not as dire this time round, but the following factors can fast change things for the worse:\n\nCrude oil prices spiking further\n\nThe bad news is that the benchmark Brent crude oil price is flirting with the $80 a barrel mark, for the first time since 2014.

The worse news is that some analysts have predicted it to hit $100 by the next year.\n\nGiven that India is the world's third largest oil importer, such a hike will inflate the import bill and disrupt the fiscal position. According to a recent Goldman Sachs report, India's current account deficit will be around 2.4 per cent of GDP in 2018-19, up from its previous forecast of 2.1 per cent. At the end of the first nine months of FY18, therefore, India's current account deficit (CAD) was pegged at $36 billion till December 2017, and is reportedly expected to increase to $48-49 billion for the full year. And as pointed out by Kotak Securities, a high deficit means the country has to sell rupees and buy dollars to pay its bills. This further reduces the value of the rupee.\n\nForeign flows\n\nAccording to the daily, May alone has seen Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) to the tune of $2.6 billion withdraw from India's stock and bond markets, and this could be a key factor precipitating the rupee's recent slide. Foreign equity investments take their cues from market valuations vis-a-vis peers, and the news is not good on that front. \"We were, and still are sceptical of valuations accorded to some of the large-capitalisation stocks in India.

The depreciation of the rupee, particularly if it weakens further to Rs 70 per dollar, would increase the cost of imports, especially crude oil, which is a significant expense for India as the world's third-largest oil importer. The article mentions that crude oil prices could spike to $100 per barrel, which would inflate India's import bill and disrupt its fiscal position. Additionally, the widening current account deficit (CAD), which is expected to increase to $48-49 billion for the full year, indicates that India will need to sell rupees and buy dollars to pay its bills, further pressuring the rupee and potentially increasing the fiscal deficit. The withdrawal of foreign portfolio investments (FPI) and the strengthening of the dollar also contribute to a challenging economic environment that could exacerbate the fiscal deficit.

The only direct mention of fiscal deficit is from Finance Secretary T.V. Somanathan, who notes that the Single Nodal Agency (SNA) Dashboard has helped reduce the float of funds, save interest costs, and contain the fiscal deficit in challenging times. However, this statement is more about current measures rather than a clear prediction of future fiscal deficit direction. There is no explicit information on government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would indicate a significant increase or decrease in the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the article does not provide a clear indication of the future direction of the fiscal deficit.",

Petrol prices were hiked by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 30 paise. The price of non-subsidised LPG was up by Rs 59 per cylinder and subsidised LPG cylinder became costlier by Rs 2.89. All this is an outcome of higher global oil prices and a weak rupee. The media and analysts these days are speculating increasingly on the possibility of crude oil prices reaching $100. This has gained traction ever since Brent crude breached the $80 mark and has sustained itself at those levels.\n\nBrent crude has averaged $75 in the fiscal so far. Much of the rise in prices is attributable to increased conformity (led by fall in output from Venezuela) towards the output deal by the OPEC and other cooperating nations, and the sentiments around US sanctions on Iran oil exports that come into force starting November. At its latest JMMC (Joint OPEC-non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee) meeting in September, the OPEC and other cooperating nations seemed to have paid little heed to the US President\u2019s rhetoric to bring down oil prices. The group of nations expressed satisfaction regarding current oil market outlook, with an overall healthy balance between supply and demand. There are no signs telling the OPEC would increase output\u2014its next meet is scheduled for December 3. The future course of output cooperation deal will become known then. But, in recent months, Russia and OPEC have hinted multiple times at a long-term output cooperation. Pipeline constraints in the US prevent US shale industry to pump out more oil and make it available to the market. With excess oil inventories gone, prices have become very sensitive to any supply-side news. On the demand side, oil demand remains strong and is yet to show any signs of weakening.\n\nSo what will be the impact of $100-barrel oil on India? India\u2019s trade deficit was $161 billion in FY18. Around 44% of this was on account of oil. India imported 1.7 billion barrels of crude in the last fiscal, worth $88 billion, when the average price of Indian basket of crude was about $52 a barrel. In the last fiscal, trade deficit on account of oil was $71 billion. In the event oil prices reach $100 a barrel, India would be importing around $14 billion worth of crude every month. If oil prices were to reach $100 and sustain themselves at elevated levels till the end of the fiscal, India\u2019s oil trade deficit would swell by almost 58% in FY19. While higher crude oil prices would also increase the value of our refined product exports, given the high base of imports versus exports, the overall impact on trade deficit would be negative.\n\nIncrease in crude oil prices leads to increase in prices of fuels at the pump. Prices of diesel and petrol are now deregulated and change on a daily basis. Diesel and petrol together have 2.19% weightage in the CPI basket. LPG accounts for 1.29% of the basket. Other components of the CPI basket too get impacted by higher fuel prices via second round effects. Crude at $100 could add 1-1.5% to the headline inflation number. Higher crude oil prices will also increase the cost of petrochemical inputs which make their way into various items, and may in turn lead to an increase in retail price of goods. Increased outlay on fuel could lead to decreased discretionary spending. This might lead to inflation easing in some of the categories like clothing & footwear and some miscellaneous items. RBI, too, has sighted high oil prices as risk to its inflation outlook.\n\nOn the fiscal front, increase in oil prices will increase the subsidy outlay\u2014kerosene and LPG are still subsidised. The budget for FY19 has budgeted petroleum subsidies at Rs 24,933 crore\u2014Rs 20,377.8 crore for LPG and Rs 4,555 crore for kerosene. An LPG cylinder costs the consumer Rs 502.4 after a subsidy of Rs 376.6. OMCs lose around Rs 19.09 per litre on kerosene. Subsidy on account of LPG will also increase as more and more people are brought under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. As of August, the government has already used up Rs 18,468.76 crore under petroleum subsidies\u201474% of the budgeted amount. The government will have to shell out more on account of subsidies unless prices of kerosene and LPG are raised, or OMCs are asked to absorb more and more burden. A cut in taxes on any of the fuels might lead to lower retail prices and in turn inflation, but at the same time will result in lower government revenues and increased fiscal burden. The petroleum sector contributed Rs 5.5 lakh crore to the government kitty last fiscal.\n\nA higher trade deficit and high inflation don\u2019t really bode well for the already weak rupee. An increase in fiscal burden might also lead to an increase in government borrowings and may push up yields. The stress on government finances has reduced considerably since subsidies have been done away with. Petrol and diesel account for around 50% of the consumption of petroleum products in India. India will improve its resilience to movement in oil prices only if we are able to make our demand for oil somewhat elastic\u2014reduce our dependence on oil imports, increase use of alternate fuels, greater use of public transport, increased adoption of carpooling, etc. Small steps in the right direction at a micro level will go a long way in yielding greater benefits at a macro level.\n\nThe swing in oil prices and its impact on the economy is nothing new. Over the years, oil prices have moved in a broad range on account of various reasons, and this current upswing might not be the last one. Given the inelastic nature of our demand for crude, India tends to benefit every time oil prices fall and faces a tough time when oil prices rise.\n\n-The author is a corporate economist.

    "deficit_analysis": "**ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article highlights several factors that suggest a negative impact on India's future fiscal deficit. Key points include:  \n1. **Higher Oil Prices:** The potential rise of crude oil prices to $100 per barrel would significantly increase India\u2019s oil import bill, widening the trade deficit. This would indirectly strain fiscal finances due to higher subsidies and inflationary pressures.  \n2. **Increased Subsidy Outlay:** The government\u2019s petroleum subsidy budget for FY19 is already 74% utilized, and higher oil prices would necessitate additional spending on LPG and kerosene subsidies, especially with the expansion of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.  \n3. **Revenue Loss:** A potential cut in fuel taxes to mitigate inflation would reduce government revenues, further exacerbating the fiscal burden.  \n4. **Inflation and Borrowing:** Higher inflation and fiscal stress could lead to increased government borrowings, pushing up yields and adding to fiscal pressures.",

As India emerges from the COVID-19 crisis, the ninth budget under the Modi government, including an interim one, is widely expected to focus on boosting spending on job creation and rural development, generous allocations for development schemes, putting more money in the hands of the average taxpayer and easing rules to attract foreign investments.Sitharaman, who had in her first budget in 2019 replaced leather briefcase that had been for decades used for carrying budget documents with a traditional red cloth 'bahi-khata', had earlier this month stated that the budget for the fiscal year beginning April will be \"like never before\".The budget, economists and experts say, will be the starting point for picking up the pieces after the economic destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . And it must go beyond being just a 'bahi khata' or a ledger of accounts, as well as canning old schemes in a new bottle.It has to be a vision statement, a roadmap to get the world's fastest-growing major economy back on track.A prescient budget, which goes a long way in instilling confidence, cannot be replaced by 'mini-budgets' such as the one in September 2019 when the government cut corporate tax rate just two months after Sitharaman presented her maiden one, or the periodic announcements of economic measures that dotted 2020.There is a larger consensus among economists that the annual GDP for FY21 will decline by 7-8 per cent, one of the weakest performances among the developing nations.The government has to play a critical role in pulling the economy out of the trough. While the pandemic is showing signs of being less virulent, a gradual progress in the vaccination programme is fuelling hope for a better future. A sustainable economic revival will need a policy catalyst. That's where this budget assumes a special relevance.The pandemic struck at a time when the economy was already caught in the grip of a growth slowdown. GDP growth touched an 11-year low of 4 per cent in 2019-20. A steadily declining investment rate has been a major factor in causing deceleration prior to the coronavirus crisis.And the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus in March last year brought economic activities to a grinding halt, causing a sharp contraction in the GDP in two successive quarters of FY21, pushing the economy into a recessionary phase.In response, the government announced a number of policy measures under Aatmanirbhar Bharat package 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 to support the economy. The package was a combination of grant, equity and liquidity measures by the central government, state governments and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).While the headline stimulus was pegged at close to Rs 21 lakh crore, the actual fiscal impact of the economic packages works out to be about Rs 3.5 lakh crore (1.8 per cent of GDP).Also, since last budget, the size of the economy has reduced from Rs 2.24 lakh crore nominal GDP considered in the FY21 budget to Rs 1.94 lakh crore. There has been lower-than-budgeted revenue growth and higher expenditure to offset the adverse impact of the pandemic.Among the most-watched figures in the budget would be the expenditure on vaccination in FY22 which could be shared among the central government, state governments and households.India has started the largest vaccination programme in the world from January 16 and is using two vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin.Also, to be watched is the revenue that the government is projecting to receive from the privatisation of companies such as Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Air India and Shipping Corporation of India (SCI).Market borrowings are expected to remain elevated and external deficit financing would increase.Higher capital expenditure outlay for National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) programme that has an aggregate investment target of Rs 111 lakh crore over the period 2020-25 and making recently introduced Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme more attractive to lure foreign manufacturers to boost domestic manufacturing are top expectations from the budget.Acuite Ratings & Research Limited said there are two primary objectives before the government at this stage - reignite the growth engine in the economy while committing itself to a medium-term fiscal consolidation path.\"The growth impetus should incentivise demand in the near term and ensure its sustainability over the medium to long term.\"Four elements must be activated to build economic vibrancy over the long term - give infrastructure a significant push through public and private investments, facilitate large-scale private and foreign investments across industrial, services and agricultural sector; incentivise private consumption in the near term without significant compromises on tax revenues; and step up allocation in health and education sectors.\"Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun and Bradstreet said unprecedented circumstances require unprecedented measures.\"Globally, governments are facing massive policy and operational challenges and are adopting unconventional measures to revive their economy. A big bang package of reforms is thus on the anvil.\"Undeniably, the government has a difficult task of manoeuvring the nascent recovery of the economy and managing the fiscal burden, which is expected to remain high not only for the current year but also for the subsequent years, he said.\"In the current scenario, it would be impossible not only for India but for countries globally to shoulder the pandemic without fiscal destabilization in the short to medium term.\"India Ratings and Research said the government finances need to be steered in a way that puts the economy back on tracks.Projecting a Rs 60,000 crore revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending March 31, it estimated the fiscal deficit at over 7 per cent in the current fiscal as against budget target of 3.5 per cent. For the next, it put the fiscal deficit at 6.2 per cent.The budget will have to address a number of issues - health infrastructure, reviving demand, banking sector reforms, fiscal consolidation and implementation of 15th Finance Commission report, said Brickwork Ratings.Centrum said, \"We expect the upcoming budget to prioritise growth-oriented measures with the commitment to warrant that the momentum of recovery seen in the economy recently remains sustainable.\"The emphasis of the budget is likely to be on the revitalization of durable consumption impulses at the current juncture as the supply-side measures have already been implemented.Alongside, the key focus will also remain on the further fostering of private investments as well after the initiation of a slew of measures like corporate tax rate cut, NIP and PLI scheme on this front, it said.Amidst a plethora of market expectations around the budget FY22, key areas where the central government is highly anticipated to put its more attention to are the establishment of a bad bank to clean up bank balance sheets, presenting finer contours of the PLI scheme for boosting manufacturing for the 10 sectors announced earlier and resources likely to be made available.Others include offering sops to reinvigorate household consumption demand via tax incentives for spending and higher deductions on housing loans coupled with the introduction of a COVID Cess that is expected to be levied on high-income individuals, it said.India Ratings and Research believes that the major focus of the government to revive the COVID-19 battered economy has till now been on the supply side, but it is high time to change gears and focus on the demand side as well, lest the ongoing recovery begins to lose steam.Its budget expectations include spending on infrastructure especially that are employment-intensive and have a shorter turnaround time, creation of development financial institutions, continue with relief/income support to the households who are at the bottom of the pyramid and higher allocation to MGNREGS as it provided a safety net not only to rural households but also to the workers who migrated back to rural areas.Also, more support to real estate given its backward-forward linkage in the economy especially affordable housing segment, boosting micro small and medium enterprises, reprioritisation of both revenue and capital expenditure towards essentials such as top priority to mass vaccination/public health, reprioritisation of expenditure and mobilisation of higher non-tax revenue, it added.GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, said the need of the hour is to increase credit flows, especially to small and medium enterprises sector, as well as investment in education and health sectors to boost production and consumption.Gargi Rao, Economic Research Analyst at GlobalData, said, \"The expectations from the upcoming budget are mainly inclined towards infrastructure development, tax concessions for elderly to provide a breather for consumers to increase their overall consumption, along with increasing domestic production.\"The budget will come as an economic vaccine for the pandemic-battered economy and steer India with the much-needed stimulus to boost demand, consumer confidence and at the same time boost the purchasing power of the people, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said, adding incentives to industries like textiles, apparel, leather, food processing, construction and retail are expected.",

A big bang package of reforms is thus on the anvil.\"Undeniably, the government has a difficult task of manoeuvring the nascent recovery of the economy and managing the fiscal burden, which is expected to remain high not only for the current year but also for the subsequent years, he said.\"In the current scenario, it would be impossible not only for India but for countries globally to shoulder the pandemic without fiscal destabilization in the short to medium term.\"India Ratings and Research said the government finances need to be steered in a way that puts the economy back on tracks.Projecting a Rs 60,000 crore revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending March 31, it estimated the fiscal deficit at over 7 per cent in the current fiscal as against budget target of 3.5 per cent. For the next, it put the fiscal deficit at 6.2 per cent.The budget will have to address a number of issues - health infrastructure, reviving demand, banking sector reforms, fiscal consolidation and implementation of 15th Finance Commission report, said Brickwork Ratings.Centrum said, \"We expect the upcoming budget to prioritise growth-oriented measures with the commitment to warrant that the momentum of recovery seen in the economy recently remains sustainable.\"The emphasis of the budget is likely to be on the revitalization of durable consumption impulses at the current juncture as the supply-side measures have already been implemented.Alongside, the key focus will also remain on the further fostering of private investments as well after the initiation of a slew of measures like corporate tax rate cut, NIP and PLI scheme on this front, it said.Amidst a plethora of market expectations around the budget FY22, key areas where the central government is highly anticipated to put its more attention to are the establishment of a bad bank to clean up bank balance sheets, presenting finer contours of the PLI scheme for boosting manufacturing for the 10 sectors announced earlier and resources likely to be made available.Others include offering sops to reinvigorate household consumption demand via tax incentives for spending and higher deductions on housing loans coupled with the introduction of a COVID Cess that is expected to be levied on high-income individuals, it said.India Ratings and Research believes that the major focus of the government to revive the COVID-19 battered economy has till now been on the supply side, but it is high time to change gears and focus on the demand side as well, lest the ongoing recovery begins to lose steam.Its budget expectations include spending on infrastructure especially that are employment-intensive and have a shorter turnaround time, creation of development financial institutions, continue with relief/income support to the households who are at the bottom of the pyramid and higher allocation to MGNREGS as it provided a safety net not only to rural households but also to the workers who migrated back to rural areas.Also, more support to real estate given its backward-forward linkage in the economy especially affordable housing segment, boosting micro small and medium enterprises, reprioritisation of both revenue and capital expenditure towards essentials such as top priority to mass vaccination/public health, reprioritisation of expenditure and mobilisation of higher non-tax revenue, it added.GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, said the need of the hour is to increase credit flows, especially to small and medium enterprises sector, as well as investment in education and health sectors to boost production and consumption.Gargi Rao, Economic Research Analyst at GlobalData, said, \"The expectations from the upcoming budget are mainly inclined towards infrastructure development, tax concessions for elderly to provide a breather for consumers to increase their overall consumption, along with increasing domestic production.\"The budget will come as an economic vaccine for the pandemic-battered economy and steer India with the much-needed stimulus to boost demand, consumer confidence and at the same time boost the purchasing power of the people, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said, adding incentives to industries like textiles, apparel, leather, food processing, construction and retail are expected.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article strongly suggests that the government is planning to increase spending significantly in key areas such as healthcare, infrastructure, defense, job creation, rural development, and vaccination programs. Additionally, there are mentions of tax reliefs, incentives for industries, and measures to boost private consumption and investments. While these measures are aimed at economic recovery, they are likely to lead to higher government expenditures. The article also highlights that fiscal deficits are expected to remain elevated in the near to medium term, with projections of a 6.2% deficit for the next fiscal year, significantly above the target of 3.5%. Although there are some efforts to increase non-tax revenues (e.g., privatization of companies), the overall direction points to a widening fiscal deficit due to increased spending and lower-than-expected revenue growth.  \n\n**",

That produces the same amount of crop next year. If he desires a higher output, then he needs to set aside a higher share of current output. This is the basic insight of the savings rate. What is saved for next year is what\u2019s not consumed. From the aggregate production of this year, let\u2019s call it the gross domestic product (GDP), the portion set aside (i.e. saved) is used as investment (sowing seeds) for future growth. Today\u2019s savings translates into tomorrow\u2019s GDP through a capital output ratio. This is Economics 101. The seeds for next year (i.e. investment) needed can also be borrowed or imported. In which case, the output next year has to factor repayments, interest obligations and exchange rates. Output is produced with a combination of seeds (capital) and the farmer\u2019s own effort (labour). This is the basic growth model, attributed to Roy Harrod and Evsey Domar from the 1940s, and later embellished by Nobel laureate Robert Solow. The intuition that a high savings rate sustains high growth has been tested and confirmed across the world and has withstood all macroeconomic crises and business cycles. Even zero growth needs basic savings and investment to sustain a constant output.\n\nTwo questions arise. First, just how much should one save? Too much savings may lead to diminishing returns. There is thus a golden ratio. Besides, if the bulk of savings can come from foreigners, then the domestic population can enjoy a higher consumption level or standard of living. But you can\u2019t borrow indefinitely from the world. Optimal domestic savings is a must.\n\nSecond is the question whether savings cause income growth or vice-versa. Higher income makes higher (absolute) savings possible. And higher savings lead to higher growth and income. This two-way relationship has a chicken-and-egg element. Yet, macro policies mandate that higher savings are a prerequisite for high growth.\n\nMuch of the East Asian long-term miracle growth was predicated on a high savings rate. In some countries, it has been coercive, with high compulsory savings for pensions. Savings rates have peaked at 50% in China. The flip side of such high and ultimately wasteful savings is that consumer spending as a proportion of GDP is rather low. In China, it was stuck at 35% for a long time, while in India it has been above 65%.\n\nIndia\u2019s savings rate climbed steadily from below 10% during the 1960s to a peak of 37% in 2010-11. During 2004 to 2012, it was close to the optimal ratio. A combination of high savings, high growth, high tax collections, lower deficits and low interest rates was the virtuous cycle enjoyed by India during the first decade of this century. Then irrational exuberance took over. This led to over exposure to large risky loans in infrastructure and policy paralysis. By 2013, we were in taper-tantrum territory. Unsustainable fiscal spending had led to runway inflation and a falling exchange rate. Later years saw more shocks by way of demonetization, the NBFC crisis, a botched GST rollout and the pandemic. The gross savings rate fell from 36.9% of GDP in 2010-11 to 30.2% in 2021-22.\n\nWe need to distinguish between financial and non-financial savings. Roughly 60% of savings are non-financial and go into gold or real estate. This ratio rose to 65% in 2021-22. But financial savings are showing a worrying trend. The Reserve Bank of India reported this week that net financial savings of households have fallen to a near 50-year low of 5.1% in 2022-23. This ratio was 11.5% in 2020-21 and 7.2% in 2021-22. Financial savings are held as bank deposits, stocks, bonds and insurance policies. Households are taking on more debt, and additions to their net financial assets in absolute terms have dropped steeply from \u20b922.8 trillion in 2020-21 to \u20b913.8 trillion in 2022-23. In 2022-23, growth in household financial liabilities was a whopping 76%. These again rose from \u20b936 trillion in July 2022 to \u20b947 trillion in July 2023. A big contribution was from non-bank financial companies (NBFCs). Their net credit to households is up 1,000% in one year, from \u20b921 billion in 2021-22 to \u20b92.4 trillion in 2022-23. Is this loan pushing? Most of the increase is accounted for by loans for housing and vehicle purchases and personal loans. Together these account for 88% of NBFC credit to homes. Are we headed for a housing debt bubble?\n\nThe fact is that India\u2019s gross savings rate is still six-percentage-points below the golden ratio needed for sustained 8% growth. The government\u2019s contribution is negative and corporate sector support is also marginal. Foreign savers are fair weather friends who contribute less than 2%. Hence, most of the burden is on the household sector, which has long been of support. But much of what households save is gobbled up by insatiable government borrowing. With high inflation and interest rates, sputtering income growth and lengthening home-loan repayment tenures, we may be headed in the opposite direction of the virtuous cycle seen during 2003-2011. An unsustainable rise in household indebtedness, especially for home loans, is not a sign of confidence. It could be a harbinger of rising bad loans. Rising interest rates are inevitable with a wide fiscal deficit and high inflation. The only way to reverse this decline in our savings rate is the old fashioned way of fiscal discipline, a strict vigil kept on inflation, a tight rein on loan pushing, and overall macro stability.",

Railway board chairman V K Yadav said on Thursday that the bidding process for private operators to run 109 pairs of passenger -rain routes through 151 modern trains will be finalised by April next year, and the trains will start operations latest by April 2023.\n\nWhile the plan falls short of privatisation \u2014 the many expert panels which laid out the road map for the much-delayed rapid expansion-cum-modernisation of India\u2019s railway infrastructure also fought shy of the word \u2018privatisation\u2019 \u2013 the new move would likely herald a surge in the long-elusive private investments in Indian railways systems. It will also reduce the IR\u2019s reliance on borrowed funds to meet its expansion requirements.\n\nThe Railways has drawn up Rs 50-lakh-crore infrastructure investment plan for the ten years till 2030. But the transporter\u2019s tryst with public-private partnership (PPP) model has yielded only moderate results so far. One reason for this is that most lucrative areas like passenger train operations have been out bounds for potential private investors. This hesitant approach to privatisation has continued for long, despite the fact that the transporter\u2019s own surpluses have been meagre (it is actually running an operational deficit; under-investment in certain designated funds meant for replenishment of assets etc. has allowed it to show measly surpluses).\n\nEven for the financial year 2019-20, PPP component under extra budgetary resources (EBR) \u2014 which has increasingly become the mainstay of railway capex \u2014 was budgeted at 33% of the total EBR. At Rs 28,100 crore, PPP during the year, according to the budget estimate, was barely 18% of the total capex outlay of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.\n\nThe decision to invite request for qualifications (RFQs) for private sector participation to run 109 pairs of passenger -rain routes through 151 modern trains alone is expected to generate private investments of about Rs 30,000 crore. It is very much likely that more routes will be made available for private operators, sooner than later. The private trains in PPP mode in the first phase will comprise only 5 % of railways overall operations; this confirms the scope for private investments in passenger operations is huge.\n\nA clutch of companies including R K Catering, Adani Ports and MakeMyTrip and also airlines, including Indigo, Vistara and SpiceJet are reportedly likely to the bid for operating private trains in the initial phase.\n\n\u201cTrains shall be designed for a maximum speed of 160 kmph. There would be a substantial reduction in journey time. The running time taken by a train shall be comparable to or faster than the fastest train of the Indian Railways operating in the respective route,\u201d the railways said. The concession period for the project shall be 35 years and the private entity shall pay the Indian Railways fixed haulage charges, energy charges as per actual consumption and a share in gross revenue determined through a transparent bidding process.\n\nThe 109 origin-destination routes have been formed into 12 clusters across the Indian Railway network. Each train shall have a minimum of 16 coaches. The Railways also said that majority of these modern trains are to be manufactured in India as \u2018Make in India\u2019 and the private entity shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating and maintaining the trains.\n\nSuggestions to broad-base PPPs is not new, but IR has not been able to implement the schemes.\n\nThe DK Mittal committee in its report in 2014 suggested PPP investments in core operational areas of the railways. All wagons could be owned by the private sector, it has said, adding that passenger trains could be either fully owned by private players or taken on a lease basis from IR. There have also been suggestions to have private train operators paying rentals to IR for track access, but none of these has materialised.\n\nA committee headed by Niti Aayog member Bibek Debroy had also advocated private participation in core railway projects. The Debroy panel also called for commercial accounting, track access, decentralisation and an independent regulator. But the powerful railway board has apparently been wary of privatsation. With the borrowing cost of the railways surging, the government has apparently put its foot down. Large-scale private investments seem to flow in, to complement the limited budgetary and own resources of the railways, to fund its humungous modernisation requirements.\n\nIn the Budget FY20 presented in July last year, the PPP mode has been recommended for tracks, rlling stock manufacturing and delivery of passenger and freight services. \u201cWe have lined up a whole gamut of investments for regional connectivity through government expenditure and private funding also. It has been presented to me and we have gone through them,\u201d railway minister Piyush Goyal had said, immediately after that Budget.\n\nAccording to Yadav, the new private modern trains will be placed in Bengaluru from where they will be despatched to different routes. He added that one main criterion of selecting the routes for private operations is the unmet demand of the passengers. Railways, he said, have estimated the requirement of reserved seats annually at 8.4 billion. \u201cThe purpose of these private trains is to fill the gap between the demand and availability of reserved seats. The estimate is that Railways will carry 13 billion pasesngers annually by 2030 and 18 billion by 2040,\u201d he said.\n\nAiming to provide airline-like services to train passengers, the national transporter has said that the private players, apart from fixing fares, have to also provide facilities like catering, cleaning and supply of beddings to passengers. Earlier this year, the Niti Aayog and the Indian Railways came out with a discussion paper for running 150 trains on 100 routes by private operators, envisaging an investment of Rs 22,500 crore. The discussion paper titled \u2018Private Participation: Passenger Trains\u2019 has identified 100 routes, including Mumbai Central-New Delhi, New Delhi- Patna, Allahabad-Pune and Dadar-Vadodara. Other prominent routes include Howrah-Chennai, Howrah-Patna, Indore-Okhla, Lucknow-Jammu-Tawi, Chennai-Okhla, Anand Vihar-Bhagalpur, Secunderabad-Guwahati and Howrah-Anand Vihar.",

The estimate is that Railways will carry 13 billion pasesngers annually by 2030 and 18 billion by 2040,\u201d he said. Aiming to provide airline-like services to train passengers, the national transporter has said that the private players, apart from fixing fares, have to also provide facilities like catering, cleaning and supply of beddings to passengers. Earlier this year, the Niti Aayog and the Indian Railways came out with a discussion paper for running 150 trains on 100 routes by private operators, envisaging an investment of Rs 22,500 crore. The discussion paper titled \u2018Private Participation: Passenger Trains\u2019 has identified 100 routes, including Mumbai Central-New Delhi, New Delhi- Patna, Allahabad-Pune and Dadar-Vadodara. Other prominent routes include Howrah-Chennai, Howrah-Patna, Indore-Okhla, Lucknow-Jammu-Tawi, Chennai-Okhla, Anand Vihar-Bhagalpur, Secunderabad-Guwahati and Howrah-Anand Vihar.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article discusses the Indian Railways' decision to involve private operators in running passenger trains through a public-private partnership (PPP) model. This move is expected to reduce the Railways' reliance on borrowed funds for its expansion and modernization plans, which could positively impact the fiscal deficit by decreasing government borrowing needs. The article highlights that private investments of about Rs 30,000 crore are expected from this initiative, with potential for further private sector participation in the future. Additionally, the Railways' long-term infrastructure investment plan of Rs 50 lakh crore until 2030 suggests significant capital expenditure, but the PPP model could mitigate the fiscal burden on the government. While the article does not explicitly predict the future fiscal deficit, the emphasis on private investment and reduced borrowing implies a potential decrease in the fiscal deficit over time.  \n\n**",

The key factors to watch next week include the Maharashtra Assembly elections, Q2 earnings reports from mid and small-cap companies, and upcoming IPOs and listing.\n\nMaharashtra Assembly elections\n\nThe upcoming elections in Maharashtra is one of the most anticipated events this week. Maharashtra is a key contributor to India\u2019s GDP and an important automotive hub. The state has been attracting fair bit of FDI inflows as well.\n\nAfter the Lok Sabha elections, Maharashtra\u2019s Deputy CM presented a state budget with populist measures. One major proposal announced was the cash aid for women in low-income households. However, these steps can also push the fiscal deficit further. Also BJP led Mahayuti is known for keeping Infrastructure projects on high priority and that could change if there not in power.\n\nAnother major deciding factor could be the farmers of Maharashtra. The soybean and cotton prices are a major concern for the Mahayuti alliance as Maharashtra heads to polls on November 20. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, key constituencies in cotton and soybean regions played a decisive role in the Mahayuti alliance\u2019s defeat. These issues could impact voter sentiment in the upcoming assembly elections which could also impact sentiment in the stock market.\n\nThe Voting for the 288 seats in the Maharashtra legislative assembly will be held in a single phase on November 20 and counting is scheduled on November 23.\n\nIndustry Updates\n\nThough the fair bit of earnings are already announced, some mid and small-cap earnings are expected this week. Investors will be looking for any signs of growth, margin pressure, and guidance for the coming months. The sector-specific reports, especially in IT, banking, and automobiles, could provide fresh insights into the economic recovery or challenges in the second half of FY24.\n\nUpcoming IPOs\n\nThe NTPC Green Energy IPO will open on November 19 and close on November 22. The company plans to raise Rs 10,000 crore by issuing 92.59 crore fresh shares. The allotment is expected to be finalized on November 25, with the listing on the NSE and BSE anticipated on November 27.

The IPO will open on November 21 and close on November 26. Similarly, C2C Advanced Systems aims to raise Rs 99.07 crore through the sale of 43.84 lakh fresh shares in its SME IPO, which will open on November 22 and close on November 26. The allotment of shares for both IPOs is expected to be finalized on November 27.\n\nStock market movement Last week\n\nThe Indian stock market has been under pressure for some time. In the past month period, the NIFTY 50 Index has fallen by 5 per cent as from 24,781 on October 21, 2024 to 23,532 till November 14, 2024.

It is also questionable whether Modi will really turn as \u201cpopulist\u201d as some fear since this will be contrary to his whole political ethos which is about encouraging development and investment, not handouts,\" said Wood.Wood said that the valuations of the Indian stock market remain high, particularly in the mid-cap segment, though they are lower than peak levels hit earlier this year.Corporate profits as a percentage of nominal GDP remain comparatively depressed, which reflects continuing lack of a new investment cycle, he said.\"The commencement of a new investment cycle becomes much more likely if the NPL overhang in the banking system is finally resolved,\" said Wood.On risks to the Indian market, Wood said a sharp slowdown in mutual fund inflows is a clear risk.\"This risk grows the more the stock market declines.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses various economic factors affecting India, including concerns about the rupee, oil prices, and the current account deficit. However, it specifically addresses fiscal deficit concerns by noting that the budgeted central government fiscal deficit of 3.3% for the fiscal year does not indicate extreme fiscal laxity. The strategist, Christopher Wood, also downplays fears of increased populist spending under Prime Minister Modi, suggesting that Modi's political ethos focuses on development and investment rather than handouts. This implies that there is no significant expectation of a future increase in fiscal deficit. While there are risks mentioned, such as rising oil prices and potential currency risks, these are not directly linked to an increase in fiscal deficit. Therefore, the article does not suggest a future increase in fiscal deficit and instead implies stability or controlled fiscal management.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights a significant economic contraction in India for the current fiscal year, with projections of a 9% decline in GDP. While it mentions a potential rebound of 8% growth in the next fiscal year, it also underscores several risks that could negatively impact future fiscal health. These risks include prolonged or resurgent COVID-19 outbreaks, increasing public and private debt levels, and rising non-performing loans. Higher debt levels and financial sector weaknesses could strain government finances, potentially leading to increased borrowing or reduced fiscal flexibility. Although the article does not explicitly discuss government spending plans or tax revenue projections, the mentioned risks suggest potential pressures on the fiscal deficit in the future. Therefore, the implications lean toward a possible increase in the fiscal deficit.",

He also said that many countries like India will see a skyrocketing of the debt to GDP ratio in this time which is marred by a dip in GDP and pushed for an open trade and investment climate, saying help has to come from outside in such a climate. The US and China will eventually have to take on leadership and smaller democracies can persuade the two big powers of the world to come together, Rajan said, hoping that the upcoming Presidential election in the US can change the course of things.

Raghuram Rajan discusses the RBI's expansion of its balance sheet and purchase of government debt, which he cautions cannot be a lasting solution. He also mentions the limits to monetization of fiscal deficits, indicating that such measures are temporary and could lead to concerns about inflation and debt repayment. Additionally, Rajan points out that the economic damage from lockdowns will eventually be uncovered, with costs transferring to the financial sector, necessitating government intervention to ensure lenders are adequately capitalized. He also notes that many countries, including India, will see a significant rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio due to a dip in GDP. These factors collectively suggest that future fiscal deficits are likely to increase as the government may need to spend more to address these economic challenges.",

In that scenario, we have had good governments in the past which did much for economic development and those policies may have had their pluses and minuses, but it is time to change the structure of governance, distribution of power between Centre and States, legislate on reforms in electoral processes and structures through which we run our democracy. There has been a hangover for a long time. In 1991, we had initiated reforms and it was a while back, and now with a majority government we can make the basic, fundamental changes that are needed to take things further.\n\nHow do you respond to various statements that coalition governments and their fragility have often led to the boldest reforms and policies?\n\nThey were coalition governments in the past that at various points of time did take bold measures but that was at a time of crisis. You could of course take strong measures like liberalisation and Pokhran II, but now you need a basic transformation to take the country forward. For example, transferring wider governance powers from the Centre to the States, who don\u2019t have commensurate budgetary powers. Centre can announce a policy, for example, if you announce Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) or the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), and put forward a budget, disburse that budget to various States depending on what they have been able to achieve. Like minimum wages, that should be left to the State governments to decide. If we can launch a programme today, with a majority government in power, it can adopt measures which were difficult in the coalition era, because of multiplicity of political partners and also a hangover of before.\n\nThe term of the current government is coming to an end, do you think they have missed the bus, with that kind of numerical strength to effect these fundamental changes?\n\nThey have taken a lot of measures like Goods and Services Tax (GST), Direct Benefit Transfer, Swachh Bharat, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). But the basic changes, as enumerated in the four chapters in the book, is about political reform, dealing with corruption and representation. One of the suggestions I have made is to prioritise cases against candidates standing for elections to be heard first and decided within the next six months. A parliamentary majority is an opportunity that should be made use of to make basic, fundamental changes.\n\nOne of your rather dramatic suggestions is about Parliament and the character of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe Rajya Sabha should be a true representative of the State. What I am trying to get to you is that this is the Council of States. They should represent the interests of the States. Today, I can be in any State and be elected to the Rajya Sabha from any other State. That was not the idea behind the Council of the States. The whole point was that in a federal democracy, say I was from Assam, that you represent that State's interests in the Rajya Sabha.\n\nYou have also spoken about raising revenue and saying that the government should get out of a lot of things where it has no business being in. Could you elaborate on this?\n\nThe public sector is still the largest segment in our country. What I am talking about is that where public sector agencies are concerned, very positive steps have already been taken. For example, we are now talking about the privatisation of Air India. So you can decide what is in the public interest, and if it is in the public interest, like roads, infrastructure, water supply, etc, that can remain in the public sector. But the governance of that system can be delegated to the institution that is implementing it, and the government can monitor it.\n\nThe government appoints the UPSC chairman, the Election Commissioner, and the CAG. But once appointed, they have to abide by whatever the rules of the system is, the same should be the case in terms of certain public sector units where the appointment or regulation could be via government but it is run according to the autonomous rules of that institution.\n\nWhat is the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in communicating with the markets?\n\nI was RBI governor during the Asian Crisis in the late 1990s. The main issue at that particular point of time was that we had a balance of payments problem, the Asian Crisis was there, and everybody thought that we would go bankrupt and the rupee would depreciate, and at that time it would depreciate by a large amount. Therefore, people started speculating. This is what I learnt, that people lost $3-4 billion in one week after the Asian Crisis became big.\n\nSo, we understood that everybody expects that the RBI would intervene when the rupee was at some round number. So, the first thing was, there was a tremendous consultative collaboration with the government. We discussed that if we want to target the rupee's value, then everybody would mis-speculate and we won't be able to manage. (So we decided that) when people start selling, then you intervene. It was nothing philosophical or anything. It was that if you are in a difficult circumstance, then take a bus rather than take a car.\n\nIs there a need for a policy like that today?\n\nAt the moment, we are in a very different situation because we have large forex reserves. So, we have the ability and capacity today to decide what we want to do in terms of exchange rates, in terms of interventions, in terms of whatever we want to do. Capital flows are also high, we can finance the trade deficit. So you can decide what is good for the country, what is good from a trade point of view, what is good from the growth point of view and then take a call.\n\nIs there more the government needs to do to address the NPA situation in banks?\n\nThere are several steps the government has taken such as the prompt corrective action, the IBC, so it's not just about infusing money but about changing the legal framework, which is very desirable. Hopefully, if you take prompt corrective action, I hope NPAs will decline, but it will take a couple of years. By decline, you don't want to hit it hard. You want to handle it gradually so that it doesn't affect the credit flows to entrepreneurship, infrastructure, for whatever investment you want done. Credit flows are very important. You have the ability today to manage the system, and so all these measures taken so far are very good from that point of view.\n\nYou are the chairperson of the committee tasked with selecting the new Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) to the government. Is there a deadline by which you have to make your decision?\n\nThere is no specific timetable on CEA. The idea is to do it when feasible. There are enough responses, and if you look at the notification, it says you can even get people who have not applied.\n\nThere was a lot of talk from sections of the ruling party or ideological cohorts regarding the undesirability of 'foreign educated' economists being given roles in the government. What is your view on this?\n\nWhat I am saying essentially is that if I am an Indian, I am an Indian. It doesn't matter which university I studied in. If I am doing well, then I am doing well. That is most important to get the best talent that we can get. I have no problem at all in saying that we need to get the best available.",

What is your view on this? What I am saying essentially is that if I am an Indian, I am an Indian. It doesn't matter which university I studied in. If I am doing well, then I am doing well. That is most important to get the best talent that we can get. I have no problem at all in saying that we need to get the best available.",

While it mentions initiatives like Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), it does not provide explicit projections or predictions about future fiscal deficits. The discussion on raising revenue and privatisation of public sector units like Air India suggests potential efforts to improve fiscal health, but there is no clear indication of how these measures will impact the fiscal deficit. The article lacks specific details on government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would directly influence the future fiscal deficit. Therefore, the implications for the future fiscal deficit remain neutral.",

The GDP growth in the last quarter of 2018-19 was the slowest in the last five years, and considering that the capacity utilisation in manufacturing has already peaked, reviving the investment climate is critical to accelerate economic growth. The unemployment rate, which is 6.1%, is the highest in four decades. With the Economic Survey making a pitch for creating a virtuous cycle of saving and investment, there was hope that there would be far-reaching announcements in the Budget.\n\nBalancing the books\n\nTo be fair, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has a difficult job of balancing the books, particularly when the revenues are not buoyant and demands for expenditure are high. From that perspective, it is noteworthy that she has tried to show her commitment to the process of fiscal consolidation by keeping the fiscal deficit budgeted at 3.3%. The difference between the 3.4% budgeted in the interim Budget and this is mainly due to higher GDP estimates (\u20b993,168 crore) used in the denominator. The revenue is lower by \u20b955,463 crore compared to the interim Budget estimate but this is offset by non-tax revenue estimated to be higher by \u20b940,532 crore. Thus, there are not many significant departures from the estimates of revenue and expenditure presented in the interim Budget. The gross income tax revenue is estimated to be lower than the interim Budget by \u20b990,000 crore, mainly on account of lower GST (\u20b997,857 crore) and individual income tax (\u20b951,000 crore). Despite taking lower estimates, the revenue estimates look far too optimistic in comparison with the pre-actuals given by the Controller General of Accounts. To realise the Budget estimates, the increase over the actual tax collected in 2018-19 in gross tax revenue will have to be 21.2%, net tax revenue must rise by 25.3%, and the non-tax revenue will have to increase by 27.2%.\n\nA major source of additional revenue projected in the Budget is by having an active disinvestment policy. Disinvestment is expected to generate \u20b91,05,000 crore, which is almost \u20b915,000 crore higher than what was taken in the interim Budget. The Budget speech also speaks about an active disinvestment policy beginning with Air India. Hopefully, the environment will help to implement this. Another source of revenue which is expected to increase is the dividend. This amounts to \u20b91,63,528 crore, which is \u20b921,457 crore more than what was estimated in the interim Budget. Much of this will be from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nThe most important reform measure in the Budget is the proposal to streamline multiple labour laws into a set of four labour codes. Although the details are not yet available, it is hoped that the government will embark on the much-needed reforms in this area. This is a contentious issue that has been long debated. The Economic Survey too has referred to the need to make the factor markets less distorting and the disincentives these laws create in ensuring optimal sizes. Hopefully, the government will address this in the interest of increasing employment and exports of labour-intensive goods.\n\nThe reform front\n\nOn the reform front, while much was expected, the Budget has been clearly disappointing. There are very few measures that can steer the economy to acceleration, leave alone changing gear to achieve the aspirational goal of achieving 8% growth to reach a $5 trillion economy by 2024. On the contrary, some of the measures take us back to the pre-reform era. Over the last three years, there has been a steady increase in import tariff in the name of \u2018Make in India\u2019, and with the U.S. coming hard on India by terminating India\u2019s designation as a beneficiary developing nation under the key Generalised System of Preferences programme, it was hoped that there would be an attempt at lowering and reducing the expansion of the protectionist wall. The objective of \u2018Make in India\u2019 should be to make the economy competitive and not to dish out higher cost, inferior products to domestic consumers. By selective increases in customs duty and by varying the rates based on whether the item is an intermediate good, capital good and final consumer good, the Budget has caused the effective rate of protection on many items to be much higher than the nominal rates. This can create unintended distortions. This is clearly retrograde.\n\nOne of the major initiatives needed at the present juncture is to reform the banking system. The Budget allocates \u20b970,000 crore for the recapitalisation of public sector banks, but is silent on the urgently needed structural reforms including governance reforms. Nor are there any concrete measures to deal with the Non-Banking Financial Companies crisis apart from empowering the RBI to undertake the regulatory function. Not that everything has to be done in the Budget, but events have shown that there is a need to improve both the legal framework and governance system. Consolidation of public sector banks cannot serve the purpose of changing the structure of incentives and accountability.\n\nRevive the investment climate\n\nThe revival of the economy requires the revival of the investment climate. A recent OECD study has shown that corporate taxes in India are very high amounting to almost 48% when the dividend distribution tax and surcharges are taken account of. The Budget in 2015-16 promised to bring the basic rate down to 25%. This was implemented for companies with a \u20b9250 crore turnover in the 2018 Budget; the present Budget increases it to \u20b9400 crore. Although these companies cover 90% of the number of companies, their tax payment is less than 10-15%. If large investments have to be attracted, then the reduction should have been general and the scaffolding approach can only disincentivise the companies to grow bigger and better. This only discourages the companies from becoming larger. While the Economic Survey is eloquent about the need to transform the \u2018dwarfs into giants\u2019, the various measures taken in the Budget to incentivise the MSMEs amount to reiterating that \u2018small is beautiful\u2019.\n\nCooperative federalism\n\nThe Finance Minister speaks about the rejuvenated Centre-State dynamic and commitment to cooperative federalism shown by the government during the last five years. At the same time, most of the measures taken to raise additional revenues are by way of cesses and surcharges. The increase in income tax for people with more than \u20b92 crore and \u20b95 crore is by way of additional surcharge. Similar is the case with additional tax on petrol and diesel. This is clearly to exclude the additional revenue raised from the divisible pool and deny the share of the tax to the States. Hopefully, the Finance Commission which is deliberating on the devolution will take note of the issue. On any case, such measures do not promote cooperative federalism.\n\nM.

However, there are several concerning factors that could pressure future fiscal deficits. Revenue estimates appear overly optimistic, with significant increases required in gross tax revenue, net tax revenue, and non-tax revenue to meet budget targets. Additionally, the government is relying heavily on disinvestment and dividends from the Reserve Bank of India to boost revenue, which may not be sustainable or reliable.

He justified the White Paper on the decade-long Congress-led UPA government, saying if he had preferred political expediency over national interest, he could have brought this out much earlier but that would have created panic.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit on Friday, Modi said he has been in the process of preparing the roadmap for his third term for the last 18 months and has taken feedback from over 1.5 million people till now. General elections are due to be held in April-May.\"New Bharat will work at superspeed - this is Modi's guarantee,\" he said.Money saved is money earned, he said, adding that direct benefit transfer (DBT) has weeded out 100 million fake beneficiaries and put the funds into the bank accounts of the deserving.DBT has saved \u20b93 lakh crore of public money while JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, mobile) has saved another \u20b96,500 crore.\"When the curse of incremental thinking infects you, you bind yourself into limits,\" Modi said, adding that when he took over as Prime Minister in 2014, he found the bureaucracy was also suffering from this malaise and there was an urgent need to change the mindset. Doing so has led to record achievements in infrastructure development and the completion of ambitious projects in a time-bound manner. He also underlined that people know that the PM inaugurates the projects for which he lays the foundation stone.Striking an optimistic note, he recalled the views expressed about India in international forums, especially at the World Economic Forum at Davos.\"The trust of the whole world in India is constantly increasing. An unprecedented enthusiasm towards India was seen at Davos.... There is no place where India does not have clout today... One expert called India a raging bull... Never before was there so much positive sentiment towards India. I had said at my Red Fort (Independence Day) speech, yahi samay hai, sahi samay hai,\" Modi said.He added that the country has carved a niche in both digital and physical infrastructure development.The PM asserted that there comes a time when all aspects become favourable and this is that moment. A virtuous cycle has begun, he said, with the economic growth rate rising and the fiscal deficit shrinking. Exports are swelling, the current account deficit is falling. Investment is rising, inflation is under control. Opportunity and income are going up, poverty is falling. Consumption and corporate profit are up, banks' non-performing assets have seen a record reduction. Production and productivity are also up.In a lighter vein, the Modi said even his critics are at an all-time low.Economic discipline has been the hallmark of his dispensation, the Prime Minister emphasised, and cited the interim budget as a prime example. It has won all-round praise for not being populist. Stability, consistency and continuity have been and will be the motto in future, he said.The fightback against the Covid pandemic was another example where, Modi said, he had not paid heed to some countries which insisted on more and more spending. \"Jaan hai to jahaan hai,\" Modi recalled his slogan then and said India has managed to control inflation while also performing its duty of being a welfare state.He justified the White Paper, saying if he wanted to play politics, he could have presented it during the 2019 general elections or even in 2014 when he had taken over as PM. The economic situation then was alarming and bringing a White Paper then would have caused panic, he said.\"I would have gained by playing politics over it but I chose rashtra niti (national interest) over rajniti (political expediency),\" he said.Charging the opposition and capitalists with discussing 'garibi hatao' (poverty alleviation) from air-conditioned rooms, he maintained that only when the son of a poor person became PM did this programme take off. He said 250 million people were raised from poverty in the last decade.Modi said his government's budgets had followed four principles - pushing capital expenditure to record levels, unprecedented investment on welfare schemes, controlling wasteful expenditure and financial discipline.The theme of the summit - Disruption, Development and Diversification - was highly apt, the PM said.",

Production and productivity are also up.In a lighter vein, the Modi said even his critics are at an all-time low.Economic discipline has been the hallmark of his dispensation, the Prime Minister emphasised, and cited the interim budget as a prime example. It has won all-round praise for not being populist. Stability, consistency and continuity have been and will be the motto in future, he said.The fightback against the Covid pandemic was another example where, Modi said, he had not paid heed to some countries which insisted on more and more spending. \"Jaan hai to jahaan hai,\" Modi recalled his slogan then and said India has managed to control inflation while also performing its duty of being a welfare state.He justified the White Paper, saying if he wanted to play politics, he could have presented it during the 2019 general elections or even in 2014 when he had taken over as PM. The economic situation then was alarming and bringing a White Paper then would have caused panic, he said.\"I would have gained by playing politics over it but I chose rashtra niti (national interest) over rajniti (political expediency),\" he said.Charging the opposition and capitalists with discussing 'garibi hatao' (poverty alleviation) from air-conditioned rooms, he maintained that only when the son of a poor person became PM did this programme take off. He said 250 million people were raised from poverty in the last decade.Modi said his government's budgets had followed four principles - pushing capital expenditure to record levels, unprecedented investment on welfare schemes, controlling wasteful expenditure and financial discipline.The theme of the summit - Disruption, Development and Diversification - was highly apt, the PM said.",

If the source is higher energy prices, for example, then build renewable energy (RE) capacities. If it is high-priced food imports, address domestic agricultural sustainability.

Yet officials say that, given the choice, they would choose growth sustained by state investment over a fiscal straitjacket.\n\n\u201cSome degree of flexibility on fiscal discipline should not be seen as irresponsible fiscal management,\u201d one senior government official told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nA fiscal advisory panel, which includes Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel, has advocated widening the budget deficit to \u201cslightly over\u201d 3% of gross domestic product to free up funds for road, railway and irrigation projects.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to keep up the pace of capital expenditure without increasing the fiscal deficit beyond 3 percent of GDP,\u201d another official, briefed on the committee\u2019s findings, added. New Delhi earlier aimed to cut the federal deficit to 3% of GDP over the next two fiscal years, compared with 3.5% in the year now drawing to a close.\n\nIndependent economists are also pencilling in a higher federal deficit in the coming fiscal year, at 3.3-3.4% of GDP, creating room for the government to invest an extra $6 billion. That has drawn a warning from ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, which says that slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation could delay India\u2019s chances of an upgrade due to its high and rising debt levels.\n\nHeroic assumptions\n\nJaitley\u2019s team forecasts a recovery in nominal GDP growth, the key driver of tax revenues, to around 12% in 2017-18. Yet that assumes oil prices of $55-60 per barrel and a long-delayed goods and services tax (GST) being implemented in July.\n\nAnd the economy is still getting over the shock of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decision in November to scrap 86% of cash in circulation in a bid to purge the economy of illicit \u201cblack money\u201d.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has chopped a percentage point off India\u2019s forecast of real economic growth to 6.6% in the current fiscal year to March, meaning China regains the crown as the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy. The Washington-based lender has also shaved 0.4 of a percentage point off its forecast for the coming fiscal year.\n\nFinance ministry officials remain tight-lipped about how quickly they expect growth to bounce back after it slowed following so-called demonetisation. International prices for crude oil, India\u2019s most expensive import item, could meanwhile overshoot the finance ministry\u2019s expectations as exporting nations curb output, hurting the growth and revenue outlook.\n\n\u201cThis budget is presented in a very uncertain situation,\u201d said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a New Delhi think-tank that is partly funded by the government.\n\nModi faces the imminent verdict of voters in five regional elections, most importantly in the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh that is home to more than 200 million people. A setback there for his Bharatiya Janata Party could harm his chances of winning a second term in 2019.\n\nElection authorities have barred the government from offering targeted budget \u2018sops\u2019 to buy votes.",

A fiscal advisory panel, which includes Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel, has advocated widening the budget deficit to \u201cslightly over\u201d 3% of gross domestic product to free up funds for road, railway and irrigation projects. \u201cIt is not possible to keep up the pace of capital expenditure without increasing the fiscal deficit beyond 3 percent of GDP,\u201d another official, briefed on the committee\u2019s findings, added. New Delhi earlier aimed to cut the federal deficit to 3% of GDP over the next two fiscal years, compared with 3.5% in the year now drawing to a close. Independent economists are also pencilling in a higher federal deficit in the coming fiscal year, at 3.3-3.4% of GDP, creating room for the government to invest an extra $6 billion. That has drawn a warning from ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s, which says that slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation could delay India\u2019s chances of an upgrade due to its high and rising debt levels. Heroic assumptions Jaitley\u2019s team forecasts a recovery in nominal GDP growth, the key driver of tax revenues, to around 12% in 2017-18. Yet that assumes oil prices of $55-60 per barrel and a long-delayed goods and services tax (GST) being implemented in July. And the economy is still getting over the shock of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s decision in November to scrap 86% of cash in circulation in a bid to purge the economy of illicit \u201cblack money\u201d. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has chopped a percentage point off India\u2019s forecast of real economic growth to 6.6% in the current fiscal year to March, meaning China regains the crown as the world\u2019s fastest-growing large economy. The Washington-based lender has also shaved 0.4 of a percentage point off its forecast for the coming fiscal year. Finance ministry officials remain tight-lipped about how quickly they expect growth to bounce back after it slowed following so-called demonetisation. International prices for crude oil, India\u2019s most expensive import item, could meanwhile overshoot the finance ministry\u2019s expectations as exporting nations curb output, hurting the growth and revenue outlook. \u201cThis budget is presented in a very uncertain situation,\u201d said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a New Delhi think-tank that is partly funded by the government. Modi faces the imminent verdict of voters in five regional elections, most importantly in the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh that is home to more than 200 million people. A setback there for his Bharatiya Janata Party could harm his chances of winning a second term in 2019. Election authorities have barred the government from offering targeted budget \u2018sops\u2019 to buy votes.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article strongly suggests that the future fiscal deficit will increase. Key indicators include the government's plan to borrow more than originally intended, the intention to fund taxpayer giveaways and higher public investment, and the fiscal advisory panel's advocacy for widening the budget deficit to \"slightly over\" 3% of GDP. Additionally, independent economists are predicting a higher federal deficit in the coming fiscal year, and there are concerns about the government taking too many fiscal risks. The article also mentions uncertainties such as the implementation of the GST, the impact of demonetization, and potential overshooting of crude oil prices, all of which could further strain the fiscal deficit. Despite some optimistic forecasts for nominal GDP growth, the overall tone and evidence point towards a significant increase in the fiscal deficit.",

    "full_article": "Since Budget 2019 is the last before the general election this year, it was widely expected to be an assessment of the government\u2019s performance. There was a debate on whether the Budget should have announced any substantive measures since they would bind the next government, post-election.\n\nIt turns out the report card is good enough to create space for some substantial measures. Painstaking fiscal consolidation, tax reform, more efficient delivery of subsidies, and a rise in the share of capital expenditure, have created the space to reward tax-payers as well as announce a relief measure for farmers in distress without substantially compromising fiscal consolidation. It is fair that this government, which imposed the painful reforms and undertook difficult action, should also distribute some rewards of that reform.\n\nRewards of higher growth\n\nIt may be asked how payment of \u20b920,000-\u20b975,000 crore can be made to farmers and the tax benefits given with only a marginal impact on the fiscal deficit. But a larger size economy can afford to spend larger absolute amounts with only a small rise in deficit ratios and borrowing requirements. The fact that India is the sixth largest and fastest growing economy in the world has some advantages as well as responsibilities to equitably share the rewards of growth.\n\nDemonetisation, the goods and services tax (GST) and other steps towards formalisation increased the tax base, and it follows that tax rates can themselves be cut. Again it is fair that the aam aadmi, who bore some of the costs of reform, should now benefit from the success of these. It makes good economic sense to move towards a system of a wider base and lower rates. Tax receipts have grown from 10% of GDP \u2014 a level at which they had stagnated since the tax cuts after the global financial crisis \u2014 to 12%. Although the GST has not yet resulted in a rise in indirect tax ratios above 5.5%, it is likely to do so in the future as it stabilises. The transfers to farmers and tax cuts amount to only 0.4% of GDP this year and are partially funded by a 0.3% rise in tax ratios.\n\nThe JAM (or Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) complex is the other major set of reforms that enable a smaller expenditure to have a larger impact on social welfare. Jan Dhan bank accounts opened through the country and the Aadhaar data base make a cost-effective Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) possible for farmers.\n\nRewards of lower inflation\n\nA slight rise in fiscal deficits to fund transfers to farmers does not threaten macroeconomic stability when inflation is low and food prices are crashing. In fact they are likely to help stabilise prices so that farmers do not cut production in the next crop cycle.\n\nMoreover, this year, the revenue deficit has been maintained, the primary deficit been reduced, and expenditure on capital account been increased. Better quality of government expenditure as well as the GST tax cuts, reductions in obstacles to inter-State trade, and soft commodity prices will keep inflation low.\n\nThe Budget points out that highways are being built at the rate of 27 km per day, which makes India the fastest builder in the world. Railway safety has improved. Better implementation and reduction in waste brings down costs across the board. The shift in the Budget date to earlier in the year and the focus on spending in the first half have resulted in a better achievement of sectoral spending targets this year.\n\nGovernment borrowing\n\nThe size of government borrowing is larger than what the market anticipated, and this has raised G-Sec rates. The rise in gross borrowing is because of higher redemptions but net borrowing is similar to that last year. There was a sharp rise in G-Sec yields that year. As a result, interest payments as a ratio to GDP rose to 3.2 against the budgeted 3.\n\nBut 3.4% of GDP is not a large fiscal deficit, and market conditions are likely to be more supportive of government borrowing this year. First, the international rate rise has peaked, with the U.S. Fed turning dovish and indicating that there will be no more rise; it is likely to maintain its balance sheet. Emerging market inflows are set to rise, creating demand for G-Secs up to the current cap of 6% of the domestic market. Soft oil prices will encourage foreign investors to return to Indian markets. But since global growth is slowing, inflows are unlikely to be as large as they were in 2017. Therefore, there will be more room for open market operations (OMO) from the Reserve Bank of India that support the debt market. Softening interest rates will also make banks more willing to hold G-Secs.\n\nWhen international demand is slowing, it is important to maintain domestic demand. Therefore, tax cuts, more income to farmers and various schemes to improve demand for housing, which has been under stress, are all appropriate.\n\nWhile the budgetary contribution to capital expenditure remains at about 1.6% of GDP there is a rise in internal and extra-budgetary resources, which are now larger than gross budgetary support. But public enterprises must be able to raise and use internal resources. This is a healthy sign of efficiency, market viability and reduced dependency on the government. Even market borrowing by such enterprises used for investment when private investment remains low, is likely to crowd in (rather than crowd out) private investment. It will raise demand which will induce more private investment. The latter remains still constrained by low demand at present, except for a few sectors where capacity constraints are appearing.\n\nImproving efficiencies\n\nComing back to the issue of binding the next government, post the election, it is necessary that sharing of growth benefits is done in ways that sustain growth, reduce distortions, and improve capabilities to participate in growth.\n\nWell-targeted transfers can be made without destroying fiscal consolidation and creating macroeconomic vulnerabilities. As competitive populism creates talk of unfunded universal income schemes, or farm loan waivers that hurt growth of farm credit, it is better to bind the next government to schemes that are less distorting.\n\nThe Budget continues the effort to reduce transaction costs and improve compliance incentives. Stamp duty amendments that seek to tax just one transaction, which will be shared across State governments, on the basis of the domicile of the buying client, will reduce a major market irritant, increase transactions and take the country further toward becoming one effective market.\n\nAs income tax returns rise, a less than 0.05% will be selected for scrutiny in non-discretionary, machine-based ways without any interface between the tax-payer and the examining officers, thus reducing potential tax-payer harassment.\n\nIndia is a very difficult country to change. Problems remain, but the rewards are beginning to appear and should be greeted with cheers.\n\nAshima Goyal is a member of the Prime Minister\u2019s Economic Advisory Council",

The transfers to farmers and tax cuts amount to only 0.4% of GDP this year and are partially funded by a 0.3% rise in tax ratios. The JAM (or Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) complex is the other major set of reforms that enable a smaller expenditure to have a larger impact on social welfare. Jan Dhan bank accounts opened through the country and the Aadhaar data base make a cost-effective Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) possible for farmers. Rewards of lower inflation A slight rise in fiscal deficits to fund transfers to farmers does not threaten macroeconomic stability when inflation is low and food prices are crashing. In fact they are likely to help stabilise prices so that farmers do not cut production in the next crop cycle. Moreover, this year, the revenue deficit has been maintained, the primary deficit been reduced, and expenditure on capital account been increased. Better quality of government expenditure as well as the GST tax cuts, reductions in obstacles to inter-State trade, and soft commodity prices will keep inflation low. The Budget points out that highways are being built at the rate of 27 km per day, which makes India the fastest builder in the world. Railway safety has improved. Better implementation and reduction in waste brings down costs across the board. The shift in the Budget date to earlier in the year and the focus on spending in the first half have resulted in a better achievement of sectoral spending targets this year. Government borrowing The size of government borrowing is larger than what the market anticipated, and this has raised G-Sec rates. The rise in gross borrowing is because of higher redemptions but net borrowing is similar to that last year. There was a sharp rise in G-Sec yields that year. As a result, interest payments as a ratio to GDP rose to 3.2 against the budgeted 3. But 3.4% of GDP is not a large fiscal deficit, and market conditions are likely to be more supportive of government borrowing this year. First, the international rate rise has peaked, with the U.S. Fed turning dovish and indicating that there will be no more rise; it is likely to maintain its balance sheet. Emerging market inflows are set to rise, creating demand for G-Secs up to the current cap of 6% of the domestic market. Soft oil prices will encourage foreign investors to return to Indian markets. But since global growth is slowing, inflows are unlikely to be as large as they were in 2017. Therefore, there will be more room for open market operations (OMO) from the Reserve Bank of India that support the debt market. Softening interest rates will also make banks more willing to hold G-Secs. When international demand is slowing, it is important to maintain domestic demand. Therefore, tax cuts, more income to farmers and various schemes to improve demand for housing, which has been under stress, are all appropriate. While the budgetary contribution to capital expenditure remains at about 1.6% of GDP there is a rise in internal and extra-budgetary resources, which are now larger than gross budgetary support. But public enterprises must be able to raise and use internal resources. This is a healthy sign of efficiency, market viability and reduced dependency on the government. Even market borrowing by such enterprises used for investment when private investment remains low, is likely to crowd in (rather than crowd out) private investment. It will raise demand which will induce more private investment. The latter remains still constrained by low demand at present, except for a few sectors where capacity constraints are appearing. Improving efficiencies Coming back to the issue of binding the next government, post the election, it is necessary that sharing of growth benefits is done in ways that sustain growth, reduce distortions, and improve capabilities to participate in growth. Well-targeted transfers can be made without destroying fiscal consolidation and creating macroeconomic vulnerabilities. As competitive populism creates talk of unfunded universal income schemes, or farm loan waivers that hurt growth of farm credit, it is better to bind the next government to schemes that are less distorting. The Budget continues the effort to reduce transaction costs and improve compliance incentives. Stamp duty amendments that seek to tax just one transaction, which will be shared across State governments, on the basis of the domicile of the buying client, will reduce a major market irritant, increase transactions and take the country further toward becoming one effective market. As income tax returns rise, a less than 0.05% will be selected for scrutiny in non-discretionary, machine-based ways without any interface between the tax-payer and the examining officers, thus reducing potential tax-payer harassment. India is a very difficult country to change. Problems remain, but the rewards are beginning to appear and should be greeted with cheers.

    "deficit_analysis": "**ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article suggests that while there are some measures that could slightly increase the fiscal deficit (e.g., transfers to farmers and tax cuts amounting to 0.4% of GDP), these are partially offset by a 0.3% rise in tax ratios. The overall fiscal deficit is projected to remain manageable, with the government maintaining fiscal consolidation efforts. Key points include:  \n1. **Tax Reforms and Revenue Growth:** Tax receipts have grown from 10% to 12% of GDP, and GST is expected to stabilize and increase indirect tax ratios in the future.  \n2. **Efficient Spending:** Measures like Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) and improved implementation reduce waste and enhance the impact of social welfare spending.  \n3. **Capital Expenditure:** While budgetary capital expenditure remains stable, internal and extra-budgetary resources are increasing, indicating reduced dependency on government borrowing.  \n4. **Macroeconomic Stability:** Low inflation, soft oil prices",

    "full_article": "The global economy lost steam in 2018 after a synchronized recovery in 2017 and a sluggish growth phase during 2012-16, leading to a broad-based slowdown in the first half of 2019. With escalation in US-China trade tension and growing economic policy uncertainty as a result, global trade, exports, manufacturing and investment activity have been severely impacted.\n\nAccording to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates, trade volume growth in the first half of 2019 came in at 1 percent -- the weakest since 2012 -- as the tariff war intensified, disrupting globally integrated supply chains centred around the Chinese manufacturing sector.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nGoing by data of the Peterson Institute on International Economics, average US tariff on Chinese imports has increased to above 26 percent compared to an average 3 percent at the beginning of the trade war. Similarly, China\u2019s average tariff on US exports have gone up to 21.8 percent from the earlier 8 percent.\n\nEven as manufacturing has been hit by the elevated trade barriers, services and consumer spending have been relatively resilient, especially in the US. Taking note of these developments, the IMF in its October World Economic Outlook review downgraded its forecast for 2019 global growth to 3 percent -- its slowest pace since 2008 -- and is projecting a shallow recovery in 2020 with elevated downside risks.\n\nThe latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts are gloomier, with global growth seen at 2.9 percent this year and the next, with a marginal improvement in 2021, as investments are being held back due to worries about economic uncertainty and the trade dynamics.\n\nFalling off the cliff\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nAmong major global economies, China has seen its GDP growth slip to a 30-year low of 6 percent in Q3, as rising US trade tariffs have led to a contraction in Chinese exports as well as imports. As a result, manufacturing activity has been consistently weak since the third quarter of 2018. The non-manufacturing sector, which was performing better, has lost steam too during Q3 2019.\n\nRetail sales growth, a measure of consumption, has dipped to a 16-year low. Fixed asset investment growth fell to 5.2 percent in October, its lowest level in two decades, as Chinese policymakers are focusing on reducing debt levels, which as per the latest estimates of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) have touched 306 percent of GDP.\n\nConsidering that the Chinese economy contributes almost a third of global growth, a slowdown has had a wider impact, especially on countries like South Korea and Australia, which are heavily dependent on Chinese imports for their growth. In fact, some of the biggest downward revisions for growth forecasts by the IMF are for economies in Asia like Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea, given their exposure to a slowing growth in China and spill-overs from US-China trade tensions.\n\nWeak economic activity in Euro-zone\n\nWith large exports and industrial base, Eurozone\u2019s largest economy Germany has only narrowly missed a recession in 2019. Its economy is witnessing an acute downturn in the industrial sector, along with weak exports growth, led by a contraction in global auto sales and a slowing global trade. Industrial output has contracted since August 2018, and this period of contraction has extended to September 2019. Exports growth has slowed too, with an average growth of 0.5 percent in the first eight months of 2019, after registering 3 percent expansion in 2018.\n\nThe composite PMI data in October showed that non-farm activity remained in the contraction zone. For the Eurozone as a whole, industrial production is contracting and GDP growth has slowed sharply to 1.2 percent in Q2 2019, from 2.6 percent in Q1 2018. German GDP growth deceleration has been more pronounced at 0.4 percent in H1 2019, from 1.5 percent in 2018.\n\nUS growth prospects clouded by uncertainty\n\nThe US economy is the only large economy where growth is reasonably strong and the IMF growth forecast cut is small in magnitude. It is witnessing its longest phase of economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. Real GDP growth so far this year has averaged at 2.4 percent, somewhat slower than 2.9 percent in 2018.\n\nGrowth has been supported by a strong household consumption, which in turn has been driven by a thriving labour market. Unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, real wages are rising and labour force participation rate is picking up. However, slower global growth since the middle of 2018 and increased uncertainty around the trade policy have slowed down manufacturing activity and investment spending. And with the effect of tax stimulus running out in 2020, the US yield curve has been at various points this year signalled a risk of recession by 2021.\n\nLooser monetary policy to the rescue\n\nIn response to this synchronized slowdown, central banks of economies constituting 70 percent of global GDP have simultaneously eased monetary policy. Absence of inflationary pressures, particularly from oil, has provided them the space to do so. The most notable change has been in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s policy actions.\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, the Fed was poised to continue normalising monetary policy by raising rates. However, in order to counter the spill-over risks from slower global growth, the Fed has gone for a mid-cycle adjustment and has cut the Fed funds rate by a cumulative 0.75 percent instead and has resumed balance sheet expansion to meet the liquidity needs of the US financial system. The European Central Bank too has eased its monetary levers further and has resumed quantitative easing.\n\nChinese policymakers, however, have shown restraint in providing a large stimulus to the economy and focussed on tax reforms. Monetary stimulus has been limited in comparison to the previous episodes of slowdown like in 2008 or 2015, in order to avoid reflating a debt bubble.\n\nThe IMF estimates that in the absence of such monetary stimulus, global growth would have been lower by 0.5 percent in both 2019 and 2020. This global policy stimulus has helped offset the negative impact of the US-China trade actions, which are estimated to cumulatively reduce the level of global GDP in 2020 by 0.8 percent.\n\nFear of a debt bubble\n\nThe latest Global Financial Stability report of the IMF, however, warns of persistently low interest rates encouraging financial-risk taking in search of yield and fuelling a further build-up of financial vulnerabilities in some countries and sectors due to rising debt burden. Market yields have declined sharply, with $15 trillion worth now trading at negative yields and global investors now expect interest rates to remain very low for long.\n\nLow rates have been encouraging a build-up of debt, across borrowers, especially with those with weak servicing capacity. As per latest estimates by IIF, global debt crossed all-time high above $250 trillion or 240 percent of world output during the first half of 2019, with China and US accounting for 60 percent of the new borrowing.\n\nA major driver of the debt build-up is private sector borrowings, which make up almost two-thirds of total debt. Further, the amount of dollar denominated debt issued in emerging markets has gone up sharply in recent years. Non-financial sector borrowers in emerging markets other than China, have increased their foreign currency debt, by more than 20 percent of GDP by the end of Q2 2019.\n\nAny tightening of financial conditions on global risk aversion or further strengthening of the dollar could make servicing this debt more difficult and that remains a key medium-term risk for the global economy. For emerging markets, especially in Asia, any persistent weakness in the Chinese Yuan, which is currently close to an 11-year low, is another risk, which could bring their currencies under pressure.\n\nStimulus the way out?\n\nGiven the downside risks to global growth against the backdrop of uncertainty around the trade policy and already low rates, calls for fiscal stimulus for ensuring a global recovery are growing, especially in countries like Germany, where sovereign borrowing rates are negative and budget in surplus. The OECD has recommended that advanced economies should kick-start bold public investments to support private investment in new energy technologies. The IMF, too, is urging economies with fiscal space to provide stimulus to avoid a long period of stagnation.\n\nThe year, however, is ending with asset markets turning more positive about the prospects of an economic recovery next year, following favourable developments around trade, which the US and China are looking to sign as a Phase 1 deal on trade. The next round of US tariffs comes into force on December 15, post which 97 percent of Chinese imports will be covered. The US administration has also delayed imposing tariffs on auto imports from the EU. However, considerable uncertainty persists around trade negotiations ahead of US Presidential elections in 2020 and that remains a major risk.\n\nWhere does India stand?\n\nThe global backdrop will continue to be a headwind for the Indian economy, which is already grappling with weak domestic demand, poor consumer and business sentiment, lenders\u2019 risk aversion and falling bank credit growth, credit squeeze from the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector and sector-specific challenges impeding investments.\n\nGrowth slipped to a 6-year low in Q1 FY20 and is likely to print below 5 percent in Q2 and around 5.3 percent for the whole of FY20, which is well below the potential growth rate of 6.5-7 percent. Monetary policy has stepped up stimulus to deal with this cyclical slowdown, but rising headline inflation may limit the easing space going forward, even as the policy remains accommodative.\n\nSector-specific measures to help real estate, telecom, auto and those aimed at increasing bank credit flow, especially to MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), have been taken. A discretionary fiscal measure in the form of a corporate tax cut to kick-start investment has also been undertaken. At this stage though, the need for deleveraging would take precedence over fresh investments by the corporate sector.\n\nCounter cyclical fiscal stimulus is still required, even as automatic stabilisers in the form of lower tax collections versus the Budget estimates, especially in the case of the GST (goods and services tax), have already kicked in. Other fiscal measures, particularly rationalisation of personal income taxes to support demand, along with stepping up public investments, will be required. One finding of a new NIPFP (National Institute of Public Finance and Policy) shows that demerit subsides at the general government level are still high at around 5.7 percent of GDP.\n\nFurther subsidy rationalisation can thus provide the fiscal space, especially at the state government level, for supporting growth. An expansionary fiscal policy, within the space provided under the revised FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) rules, should be used to buttress other policy measures to kick-start growth and improve sentiment.\n\nCountering the private demand slowdown and a weak sentiment is crucial. Otherwise, even a modest economic recovery could take longer than another 3-4 quarters, especially if the global risks escalate and trigger investor risk aversion.\n\nGaurav Kapur is the chief economist of IndusInd Bank.

The US administration has also delayed imposing tariffs on auto imports from the EU. However, considerable uncertainty persists around trade negotiations ahead of US Presidential elections in 2020 and that remains a major risk. Where does India stand? The global backdrop will continue to be a headwind for the Indian economy, which is already grappling with weak domestic demand, poor consumer and business sentiment, lenders\u2019 risk aversion and falling bank credit growth, credit squeeze from the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector and sector-specific challenges impeding investments. Growth slipped to a 6-year low in Q1 FY20 and is likely to print below 5 percent in Q2 and around 5.3 percent for the whole of FY20, which is well below the potential growth rate of 6.5-7 percent. Monetary policy has stepped up stimulus to deal with this cyclical slowdown, but rising headline inflation may limit the easing space going forward, even as the policy remains accommodative. Sector-specific measures to help real estate, telecom, auto and those aimed at increasing bank credit flow, especially to MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), have been taken. A discretionary fiscal measure in the form of a corporate tax cut to kick-start investment has also been undertaken. At this stage though, the need for deleveraging would take precedence over fresh investments by the corporate sector. Counter cyclical fiscal stimulus is still required, even as automatic stabilisers in the form of lower tax collections versus the Budget estimates, especially in the case of the GST (goods and services tax), have already kicked in. Other fiscal measures, particularly rationalisation of personal income taxes to support demand, along with stepping up public investments, will be required. One finding of a new NIPFP (National Institute of Public Finance and Policy) shows that demerit subsides at the general government level are still high at around 5.7 percent of GDP. Further subsidy rationalisation can thus provide the fiscal space, especially at the state government level, for supporting growth. An expansionary fiscal policy, within the space provided under the revised FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) rules, should be used to buttress other policy measures to kick-start growth and improve sentiment. Countering the private demand slowdown and a weak sentiment is crucial. Otherwise, even a modest economic recovery could take longer than another 3-4 quarters, especially if the global risks escalate and trigger investor risk aversion.

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article highlights a global economic slowdown driven by US-China trade tensions, weak manufacturing, and declining investment activity. While it discusses monetary policy easing by central banks, it also emphasizes the growing calls for fiscal stimulus in advanced economies like Germany and recommendations from the OECD and IMF for bold public investments. This suggests potential increases in government spending to counteract economic stagnation. Additionally, the article mentions India\u2019s need for counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus, including tax cuts and public investments, which could widen its fiscal deficit. The overall tone implies that fiscal deficits in major economies, including India, are likely to increase due to stimulus measures and economic challenges.  \n\n**",

One of the favourite all-time Indian myths is that one must increase tax rates to increase tax revenue\u2014and that the tax rate on Indian corporates is too low. This year, there is a greater urgency to the myths. Assembly elections are due in five major states, including in UP, a 204-million population state. If it were a country, it would be the fifth-largest in the world by population, just ahead of Brazil (201 million) and some 54 million behind Indonesia (258 million).\n\nThe stakes are high because of state elections and an (expected) people\u2019s verdict on demonetisation. If the Modi-Jaitley combine were to bring about an economically popular budget (not populist), then the fear among the political opposition is that the Modi-led BJP will run away with all the prizes. Unlike previous Budgets where indirect tax changes were paramount (an excise duty cut for Tweedledum, an excise duty increase for Tweedledee), in Budget 2017, direct tax changes should (will?) reign supreme.\n\nPersonal income tax rates were reduced to a three-tier structure (10-20-30%) in 1997. The flat corporate tax rate was reduced to 35% in 1997 and to 30% (where it now stands) in 2005. Perhaps, not coincidentally, both these changes were brought about by P Chidambaram in his role as the then finance minister. The finance ministry, and Budgets, have come forth with additional taxes in the form of surcharges and cesses over the years, but the tax rate has been considered untouchable.\n\nThis year there is good reason to hope that the government will change the structure (tax slabs and rates) in a major way. Previously (in joint work with Arvind Virmani, goo.gl/8Yb4ar and goo.gl/bl9CMx), I have discussed the desirability of increasing tax revenues by reducing tax rates. Two options, both with a negative income tax component, were offered\u2014either a flat tax rate of 12%, or a two-tier tax schedule of 10% and 20%.\n\nThis article is concerned with what needs to be done with our corporate tax rate structure. The existing reality is a flat tax rate of 30%, and an effective tax rate of 25%. The 5% gap between the stated and effective rate is because of exemptions. How does this effective tax rate compare with other countries, especially our competitors? Very badly. The Indian corporate sector is one of the most heavily taxed in the world. Don\u2019t believe me, but believe every major study done on this subject in the last decade.\n\nIn the 2012 study, in National Tax Journal, a major academic journal, Douglas Markle and A Shackelford \u201cCross Country Comparisons of Corporate Taxes\u201d find that for the two decade period 1988-2009, India had the fifth-highest effective corporate tax (23%) rate. In a 2015 study (The 2014 Global Tax Competitiveness Report), Duanjie Chen and Jack M Mintz aggregate corporate income taxes for 95 countries for every year between 2005 and 2014\u2014India had the 14th-highest corporate tax rate for the manufacturing sector (29.5%).\n\nEvery year, the Centre of Business Taxation, Oxford University, aggregates corporate income tax rates across 48 countries. They estimate two indicators of taxation\u2014Effective Average Tax Rates (EATR) & Effective Marginal Tax Rate (EMTR). In 2016, India had the fourth-highest EATR, at 30.8%; the top three are the United States, France and Argentina. India ranks seventh-highest with an EMTR of 22.8%.\n\nOne of Modi government\u2019s major goals has been to improve business conditions in India, also known as Ease of Doing Business. For the last two years, our rank has stayed constant at 130.5 (131 and 130 in 2015 and 2016, respectively). The major reason for our rank not changing is the high rate of taxation of the corporate sector. The World Bank estimates that in 2016, Indian corporates will pay a tax rate of 60.6% of corporate profits. This is composed of 21% corporate income tax, 4% dividend distribution tax, 15% social security contributions, 14% central sales tax, etc. How much do our East Asian competitors pay? An average of 35%; our South Asian neighbours pay 38%, Bangladesh corporates pay 35%. India\u2019s rank on tax rates\u2014172 out of 190 countries.\n\nSo, stop wondering as to why the investment rate has been steadily going down, and is now close to zero for the corporate sector. Stop wondering and blaming all and sundry as to why the Indian manufacturing sector does not grow, and lags behind practically every major country in the world. Start blaming ourselves, and our penchant (inherited from the socialist Congress) for taxing the rich in order not to have money to pay for the poor\u2014suit boot ki sarkar is what Modi inherited from the Congress.\n\nFinance minister Arun Jaitley had announced that he wanted to move to a 25% corporate tax rate, to be comparable to our East Asian competitors. Let us say that Jaitley removes all exemptions and reduces the corporate tax rate to 25%. If the cess and surcharge stay, then this policy will do nothing to improve India\u2019s competitiveness; the 5% reduction in tax rate will be exactly equal to the exemptions now removed. If the corporate tax rate is reduced to 25%, and cess or surcharge or exemptions are removed, then India\u2019s competitiveness will begin to improve and Make in India slogan will begin to have meaning. If exemptions are to be removed, which they should, then the corporate tax rate should be reduced to 20%. This is compatible with the maximum marginal personal income tax rate of 20%.\n\nIf tax rates are brought down, wouldn\u2019t tax revenues decline? No\u2014they will increase, because of increase in tax compliance. If the Modi government believed that reduction in tax rates did not increase tax compliance, then they were entirely wrong in their demonetisation policy. Demonetisation explicitly (and correctly) targeted tax evasion\u2014a meaningful reduction in effective corporate tax rate is the correct follow-through to the logic, and pain, of demonetisation.\n\nI have talked to several individuals about the possibility of significant, not-just-tinkering tax reforms in Budget 2017. As with much else since May 2014, the opinion is divided not along caste lines but around whether you voted for Modi (not BJP) in 2014. The people arguing for bad tax policy (i.e., don\u2019t change effective corporate tax rates) are the same who don\u2019t want Modi to be an economic reformer. If, especially post demonetisation, the corporate tax rate is not reduced, the economy will be hurt, and Modi\u2019s popularity will begin to take a hit. Most important, the economy\u2019s growth rate will begin to falter. This must be what the opponents of meaningful economic reform want.\n\nFor obvious reasons, these opponents of economic reform cloak their Trojan horse arguments in terms of helping Modi, i.e., don\u2019t cut tax rates for corporates, because this will confirm in the people\u2019s minds that the Modi government is really suit boot ki sarkar. What will truly damage Modi (and the BJP) is the economic growth not accelerating, if job growth does not begin to happen, if demonetisation pain is not replaced by demonetisation gain.\n\nA necessary political and economic strategy for India\u2019s success is for Modi/Jaitley to do the opposite of what the Nehru-Gandhi Congress has done for the last 70 years, i.e., make a significant cut in the corporate tax rate.\n\nThe author is contributing editor, The Financial Express, and senior\n\nIndia analyst at Observatory Group, a New York-based macro-policy advisory group.

    "full_article": "India watchers are in for a triple treat in the coming months. This week\u2019s Union Budget for 2019-20 will be followed by next week\u2019s meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC). The focus will then shift to the national legislative election, most likely spread over April and May. The Union Budget is the last one by the prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government while the MPC meeting will be the first to be chaired by the new RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das. The election outcome, along with its related political arithmetic, is anybody\u2019s guess, but the fiscal-monetary mix to be navigated is very much within the control of policymakers.\n\nThere is practically no room to manoeuvre on the fiscal front while there is, at best, limited scope on monetary easing. Still, on the fiscal side, we should be prepared for political expediency slightly chipping away at economic responsibility, but a massive assault will be avoided. On the monetary side, the MPC will shift its stance to neutral and also cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25%. Its cautious guidance will effectively signal scope for limited monetary easing, provided the inflation outlook offers that flexibility (which it will, in my view).\n\nThe government will likely meet the fiscal deficit of 3.3% of GDP for 2018-19, despite the sizeable shortfall in GST collection. This would be achieved thanks to a sizeable interim dividend from RBI, coupled with the usual cash accounting tricks, including delayed subsidy payments, used by successive governments irrespective of their political hue. RBI\u2019s interim dividend isn\u2019t unusual, but its size this time could raise eyebrows.\n\nOf course, these gimmicks raise legitimate questions about the quality of the underlying fiscal adjustment, but that is hardly a new issue. The fact of the matter is investors and sovereign credit rating agencies have come to accept the low quality and now often don\u2019t even raise these issues when they must. Consider the following: India\u2019s reported fiscal deficit of the Central government is understated because it counts divestment and asset sales as revenues instead of as financing items, as is the IMF\u2019s best practice.\n\nAlso, there has been increasing reliance on off-budget financing of capital expenditure in some sectors, such as roads and railways, via quasi-government entities. Add to these the widening of the state-level fiscal deficit and it is hard not to conclude that the consolidated fiscal picture\u2014which is what matters for macro management\u2014is far from inspiring. The IMF estimates India\u2019s general government debt at an elevated 70% of GDP; it has risen since 2014.\n\nSurpassingly, off-budget financing has hardly been as much of a focus as it should when the Union Budgets are announced. For the record, even the MPC and the RBI\u2019s financial stability assessment look the other way. The only reason it has captured attention now is because of the recent uncomplimentary observations by the Comptroller and Auditor General.\n\nFor 2019-20, the government will probably peg the fiscal deficit in the range of 3.1-3.3% of GDP (prior target: 3.1%) and reiterate being \u201cfirmly\u201don track to achieve the already announced forecast of 3% in 2020-21. This should keep the MPC satisfied about fiscal consolidation, though recall that achieving the 3% level has been delayed by two years. The marginal slippage shows poor fiscal discipline and is in sync with past behaviour, but is hardly the end of the world.

    "cleaned_article": "India watchers are in for a triple treat in the coming months. This week\u2019s Union Budget for 2019-20 will be followed by next week\u2019s meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC). The focus will then shift to the national legislative election, most likely spread over April and May. The Union Budget is the last one by the prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government while the MPC meeting will be the first to be chaired by the new RBI Governor, Shaktikanta Das. The election outcome, along with its related political arithmetic, is anybody\u2019s guess, but the fiscal-monetary mix to be navigated is very much within the control of policymakers. There is practically no room to manoeuvre on the fiscal front while there is, at best, limited scope on monetary easing. Still, on the fiscal side, we should be prepared for political expediency slightly chipping away at economic responsibility, but a massive assault will be avoided. On the monetary side, the MPC will shift its stance to neutral and also cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.25%. Its cautious guidance will effectively signal scope for limited monetary easing, provided the inflation outlook offers that flexibility (which it will, in my view). The government will likely meet the fiscal deficit of 3.3% of GDP for 2018-19, despite the sizeable shortfall in GST collection. This would be achieved thanks to a sizeable interim dividend from RBI, coupled with the usual cash accounting tricks, including delayed subsidy payments, used by successive governments irrespective of their political hue. RBI\u2019s interim dividend isn\u2019t unusual, but its size this time could raise eyebrows. Of course, these gimmicks raise legitimate questions about the quality of the underlying fiscal adjustment, but that is hardly a new issue. The fact of the matter is investors and sovereign credit rating agencies have come to accept the low quality and now often don\u2019t even raise these issues when they must. Consider the following: India\u2019s reported fiscal deficit of the Central government is understated because it counts divestment and asset sales as revenues instead of as financing items, as is the IMF\u2019s best practice. Also, there has been increasing reliance on off-budget financing of capital expenditure in some sectors, such as roads and railways, via quasi-government entities. Add to these the widening of the state-level fiscal deficit and it is hard not to conclude that the consolidated fiscal picture\u2014which is what matters for macro management\u2014is far from inspiring. The IMF estimates India\u2019s general government debt at an elevated 70% of GDP; it has risen since 2014. Surpassingly, off-budget financing has hardly been as much of a focus as it should when the Union Budgets are announced. For the record, even the MPC and the RBI\u2019s financial stability assessment look the other way. The only reason it has captured attention now is because of the recent uncomplimentary observations by the Comptroller and Auditor General. For 2019-20, the government will probably peg the fiscal deficit in the range of 3.1-3.3% of GDP (prior target: 3.1%) and reiterate being \u201cfirmly\u201don track to achieve the already announced forecast of 3% in 2020-21. This should keep the MPC satisfied about fiscal consolidation, though recall that achieving the 3% level has been delayed by two years. The marginal slippage shows poor fiscal discipline and is in sync with past behaviour, but is hardly the end of the world. For what it is worth, the officially reported Central fiscal deficit/GDP has shown an improving trajectory, but over a longer time period than initially planned. The big idea in the Budget 2018-19 will be the announcement of a cash transfer scheme to complement other measures for the distressed agriculture sector.

The rupee posted its biggest singleday loss against the dollar in more than four months. It lost 0.82%, or 53 paise, to close at 64.80 on Thursday \u2014 the lowest since July 3.The benchmark indices, which fell as much as 0.6% during the day, managed to erase most of the losses by the end of trading. The Sensex fell 30 points, or 0.09%, to close at 32,370. The Nifty ended 19 points, or 0.19%, lower at 10,122.A day earlier, the Fed\u2019s policy announcement rekindled hopes of an increase in rates, triggering a rush for safe-haven assets from emerging markets. Also, the US central bank announced the start of its programme to roll back the monetary largesse, known as quantitative easing (QE) in market parlance.A withdrawal of QE means shortage of cash in the system that will prevent global investors from taking additional bets, especially in emerging markets like India.Also, the supply of US bonds will increase over time, which should push up yields, supporting the dollar.\u201cThis pushes forward India\u2019s possible rating upgrade,\u201d said Ashish Vaidya, head of markets for India at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank.The government is considering a plan to relax the fiscal deficit target so it could spend additional funds in the current financial year to lift growth, Reuters reported on Thursday quoting two government sources.The benchmark bond yield shot up 9 basis points to 6.67%, pulling prices down.

    "cleaned_article": "Live Events MUMBAI: The rupee and stocks fell on Thursday as investors fretted over the prospect of the government loosening fiscal policy and breaching the target of 3.2% for the year.The US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to shrink its balance sheet also sparked off foreign fund selling and concern over the dollar\u2019s direction. The rupee posted its biggest singleday loss against the dollar in more than four months. It lost 0.82%, or 53 paise, to close at 64.80 on Thursday \u2014 the lowest since July 3.The benchmark indices, which fell as much as 0.6% during the day, managed to erase most of the losses by the end of trading. The Sensex fell 30 points, or 0.09%, to close at 32,370. The Nifty ended 19 points, or 0.19%, lower at 10,122.A day earlier, the Fed\u2019s policy announcement rekindled hopes of an increase in rates, triggering a rush for safe-haven assets from emerging markets. Also, the US central bank announced the start of its programme to roll back the monetary largesse, known as quantitative easing (QE) in market parlance.A withdrawal of QE means shortage of cash in the system that will prevent global investors from taking additional bets, especially in emerging markets like India.Also, the supply of US bonds will increase over time, which should push up yields, supporting the dollar.\u201cThis pushes forward India\u2019s possible rating upgrade,\u201d said Ashish Vaidya, head of markets for India at Singapore\u2019s DBS Bank.The government is considering a plan to relax the fiscal deficit target so it could spend additional funds in the current financial year to lift growth, Reuters reported on Thursday quoting two government sources.The benchmark bond yield shot up 9 basis points to 6.67%, pulling prices down.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the government is considering relaxing its fiscal deficit target to allow for additional spending aimed at lifting economic growth. This indicates a potential increase in government expenditure, which could lead to a higher fiscal deficit. The mention of foreign investors fearing a fiscal splurge that would cause the government to miss its fiscal deficit target of 3.2% further supports the likelihood of an increasing deficit. Additionally, the article highlights concerns over the rupee's fall and potential fund outflows, which could exacerbate fiscal pressures. Overall, the article points towards a future fiscal deficit that is likely to increase.",

Between 2011 and 2019, Bangladesh\u2019s exports grew at 8.6% every year, compared to the world average of 0.4%. The success is largely due to the country\u2019s relentless focus on products, such as apparel, in which it possesses a comparative advantage.Meanwhile, the share of Bangladeshi women in the labor force has consistently grown, unlike in India and Pakistan, where it has decreased.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article primarily focuses on Bangladesh's economic growth, export success, and social progress, with no explicit discussion of future fiscal deficit direction. However, it does mention Bangladesh's fiscal prudence, noting that the country has maintained a public debt-to-GDP ratio between 30% and 40%, significantly lower than India and Pakistan. This suggests a history of fiscal restraint. While the article highlights challenges such as the potential loss of tariff-free access to developed economies and the need for economic transformation, it does not provide specific information on government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would directly indicate a future increase or decrease in the fiscal deficit. The emphasis on fiscal prudence and the absence of any indicators suggesting increased future spending or revenue shortfalls imply a neutral outlook on the fiscal deficit.",

Travel & tourism, construction & building materials, and BPO are among sectors that are considering possible layoffs and hiring freeze early on.The Delhi government will start a massive sanitisation drive in the city's COVID-19 containment zones, declared as 'Red Zones' and the high-risk zones, identified as 'Orange Zones' from Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said. According to the government, 34 hotspots in the national capital have been identified as COVID-19 containment zones.A recommendation has come from the empowered groups and senior officials of the government to enlarge access to food by doing away with the requirement of ration card or any kind of ID, and distributing it anyone who needs it during the time of the lockdown and until normalcy resumes. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office is learnt to be examining the recommendation, which requires a policy shift. It has been suggested that the Centre ask all states to distribute free food and grains to people even without an ID card/ration card.India\u2019s fiscal deficit stood at 5.07% of gross domestic product (GDP) in February, according to a report released by the government on Thursday. This could make it difficult for the government to meet its revised fiscal deficit target of 3.8% of GDP for FY20. As per data from CGA, India\u2019s fiscal deficit touched Rs 10.36 lakh crore at the end of February. Following the Covid-19 lockdown, government revenues are likely to take a substantial hit in March.Buoyed by an increase in the output of mining and electricity generation, India\u2019s factory output grew to a seven-month high of 4.5% in February from 2% in the preceding month before the government imposed a nationwide lockdown in March due to Covid-19. The output of active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and formulations of certain cholesterol-lowering drugs, which have a 0.31% weight in the index of industrial production (IIP) climbed a sharp 256.1%, data released by the National Statistical Office showed on Thursday.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article provides several indicators that suggest a negative impact on India's future fiscal deficit. Firstly, the extension of the lockdown and the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to severely impact economic growth, with the World Bank predicting India's worst growth performance since 1991. This will likely lead to reduced tax revenues and increased government spending on healthcare, welfare, and economic stimulus measures. Additionally, the government is considering measures such as distributing free food and grains without requiring ID, which will further increase expenditure. The suspension of insolvency proceedings for six months may also lead to increased fiscal strain. While there are mentions of gradual resumption of economic activities, these are unlikely to offset the immediate fiscal pressures. Overall, the article hints at a likely increase in the fiscal deficit due to reduced revenues and increased spending.",

There is no indication of increased spending in other areas or a comprehensive fiscal strategy that would significantly influence the deficit.

While it mentions government reforms like GST and demonetization, it does not provide explicit information about future fiscal deficit direction. However, the article does highlight concerns such as high government debt (as noted by Standard & Poor's) and the need for significant reforms in education, judiciary, and policy. These factors could imply potential fiscal pressures, as addressing these issues may require increased government spending. Additionally, the article does not suggest any concrete measures to reduce the fiscal deficit or improve revenue generation.

While the article does not provide a detailed fiscal policy analysis, this single point indicates a potential increase in the future fiscal deficit.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses India's decision to cut corporate tax rates for smaller firms, which is expected to leave them with higher investible surplus and potentially stimulate job creation. However, the exclusion of larger companies, which contribute the bulk of tax collections, suggests that the overall impact on tax revenue may be limited. While the tax cut could stimulate economic activity and potentially increase tax revenues in the long term, the immediate effect is likely to be a reduction in tax collections. This could lead to a widening of the fiscal deficit in the short term, especially if government spending remains unchanged or increases. The article does not provide any information on corresponding spending cuts or other fiscal measures to offset the revenue loss, which further supports the likelihood of a future increase in the fiscal deficit.",

It mentions that the fiscal deficit for the 2022 fiscal year is estimated to reach 6.9% of GDP, which is higher than pre-pandemic levels, but there is no clear indication of whether this trend will continue, stabilize, or reverse in the future. The article highlights ongoing fiscal support by the Indian government in response to the pandemic, rising imports, and a widening trade deficit, which could exert upward pressure on the fiscal deficit. However, it also notes strong economic growth, a rebound in exports, and a services trade surplus, which could help mitigate fiscal pressures. Without explicit projections or policy announcements regarding future spending, revenue, or fiscal reforms, the article does not provide a definitive direction for the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the implications for the future fiscal deficit remain neutral.",

On the negative side, it mentions that the economic slowdown, exacerbated by demonetisation and the new sales tax, threatens to worsen Asia\u2019s widest budget deficit. Additionally, private investment remains constrained by corporate debt and low capacity utilization, which could limit tax revenue growth. On the positive side, the article suggests that structural reforms, low oil prices, and robust demographic growth could lay the foundation for sustainable growth and a rebound in the economy. However, the government is considering more measures to boost the economy, which could imply increased spending and potentially higher deficits in the short term. Overall, while there are hints of future fiscal improvement, the immediate outlook suggests potential pressures on the deficit due to economic challenges and possible stimulus measures.",

The administration, he says, is trying to not only increase the GSDP but also bring in peace by eliminating the entire terror ecosystem. Edited excerpts from an interview with Prerna Katiyar in Delhi:The state reorganisation act of 2019 was formed so that Jammu and Kashmir could be integrated with the rest of the country and to make available the common facilities that were denied to its people. Now 800-plus rules and facilities, which were not applicable or available earlier, exist here. Also, the social status of Dalits and West Pakistan Refugees was deplorable. Now they are on an equal footing. Earlier, schools and colleges used to be shut for six months. Stone-pelting was rampant. Hartal calendars used to be issued. Now we issue academic calendars. Our broader objective is total integration and we are working on this wholeheartedly.The culture of Jammu and Kashmir has always been very rich. It is the land of Shaivism, Buddhism, Sufism\u2026 there was no place for hatred. But due to political reasons that narrative got changed. There was a time when many Hindi movies were shot here. That is coming back. Music and literary festivals are being revived. The Tiranga Yatra under Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav saw 10,000 people flying the Tricolour and chanting Bharat Mata Ki Jai. Soft power is very much in play. I will soon inaugurate 10 cinema halls. A 5,000 sq ft mall, developed by UAE-based MR Group, is coming up in Srinagar. We are also working on our lost heritage sites that will involve reconstructing and reviving temples as well as building churches and mosques.The government of India gave 6,000 jobs and sanctioned 6,000 houses for their rehabilitation. When I joined in 2020, there were 3,000 vacancies but some excuse or the other was given to deny jobs. We fast-tracked the recruitment process and more than 2,700 vacancies have been filled. Similarly, land has been identified for building houses. Tenders for out for all but 700 flats. We will be giving 1,200 flats in October. All the houses will be allotted in one and a half years. Also, Kashmiri Pandits have been given jobs in safe places such as the district headquarters. No one has been posted in the interiors. Their security concerns have been addressed.One of their concerns was that they were employed under a special package. So when other government employees got promoted, they were left out. Now we have created supernumerary posts that include gazetted and non-gazetted employees. We have promoted all eligible non-gazetted officers. For gazetted employees, we have sent recommendations to the JK Public Service Commission. Those appointed in 2009 will be promoted in a few months. We have addressed all their pending issues. All that we can do we are doing. Nothing will be left to chance about their safety and well-being.Their families will get Rs 11 lakh each as compensation. The government is also contemplating giving jobs to their family members. We have also made security arrangements in places where they live. Insurance cover will also be given to them.I agree that better facilities can be provided. The topography is very difficult. We have developed a facility at Chandanwari for 3,500 pilgrims and similar facilities will soon come up at other places. Pilgrims go on foot from Chandanwari. When I went after the recent flash floods, I felt a road can be built till Baltal. The government will soon undertake a feasibility study and roads similar to those on the Char Dham route will be provided here.The EC is a constitutional body. It will decide when elections will be held. The Union home minister spoke of the timeline in Parliament: first delimitation, then elections and, at an appropriate time, statehood. Now delimitation work is over. Naturally the polls cannot be fought on the 2015 electoral list. The population has grown and changed in seven years. So the EC is looking at new electoral rolls and new polling stations. When the EC is satisfied, elections will be held.The home minister has given an assurance in Parliament. When the appropriate time comes, statehood will be granted.The Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Act came into force on October 31, 2019. After this, the Representation of the People (RP) Act is applicable here just like elsewhere in the country. One must not forget that 32,000 outsiders voted here in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. They were called non-permanent residents. They could vote in the Lok Sabha elections, but not in the Vidhan Sabha polls. Under the RP Act, now they can vote for Vidhan Sabha as well. If the Mufti (Mohammed Sayeed) sahab could fight from UP and become the home minister, then why can\u2019t others vote from Kashmir?The EC formed a Delimitation Commission (DC) headed by Justice (retd) Ranjana Desai. On changing the number and distribution of proposed seats, they sought suggestions from people, parties and leaders, including those of the opposition. Five MPs are members of the DC. Three of them are from the National Conference. They had every opportunity to raise an objection. After a decision has been made, they now give their views and create an issue.First, agriculture and allied sectors, including sericulture and horticulture \u2014 some 70% people here are dependent on them. In the last three years, J&K has made a big leap in these sectors. We are No. 3 in farmers\u2019 per capita income, after Punjab and Haryana. From a milk-deficit state, we are now surplus. Saffron is GI-tagged. Basmati rice is being exported in huge quantities. I am sure we will double the contribution of agriculture to GSDP in the next three years.Second, private investment. Till about one and a half years ago, it was a miniscule Rs 14,000 crore since Independence. On April 24, the ground-breaking ceremony of projects worth Rs 38,080 crore was done by the PM. We have received proposals for Rs 20,000 crore. We have acquired land for infrastructure projects. We are building many multi-speciality hospitals and increasing MBBS seats as well. Many UAE groups are investing here.Third, connectivity. Next year, Kashmir will get rail connectivity to Kanyakumari. Now 104 flights are operating from Srinagar \u2014 from just 32 two years back. We will be focusing on promoting tourism and hospitality.Fourth, we are bringing in transparency through our BEAMS (Budget, Estimation, Allocation & Monitoring System) portal. No work can be done without administrative approval, etendering and financial sanction. Physical verification and geo-tagging are mandatory for all development work. People can see on their mobile phones the status of roads being constructed in their villages.In 2022-23, Rs 22,126 crore has been allocated for district capital expenditure \u2014 2-3 times higher for every district. Last year it was Rs 12,600 crore, and the year before Rs 5,134 crore.Also, we had not fully tapped our electricity generation capacity, which is 18,000-220,000 MW. We are generating only 3,450 MW. We are trying to grow our economy on the back of power generation.Coordination among security forces is much better. We have the upper hand. The perception of people towards the government has changed dramatically \u2014 earlier peace was bought (by the government); now it is being established. We are trying not just to eliminate terrorists but the entire ecosystem.",

Many UAE groups are investing here.Third, connectivity. Next year, Kashmir will get rail connectivity to Kanyakumari. Now 104 flights are operating from Srinagar \u2014 from just 32 two years back. We will be focusing on promoting tourism and hospitality.Fourth, we are bringing in transparency through our BEAMS (Budget, Estimation, Allocation & Monitoring System) portal. No work can be done without administrative approval, etendering and financial sanction. Physical verification and geo-tagging are mandatory for all development work. People can see on their mobile phones the status of roads being constructed in their villages.In 2022-23, Rs 22,126 crore has been allocated for district capital expenditure \u2014 2-3 times higher for every district. Last year it was Rs 12,600 crore, and the year before Rs 5,134 crore.Also, we had not fully tapped our electricity generation capacity, which is 18,000-220,000 MW. We are generating only 3,450 MW. We are trying to grow our economy on the back of power generation.Coordination among security forces is much better. We have the upper hand. The perception of people towards the government has changed dramatically \u2014 earlier peace was bought (by the government); now it is being established. We are trying not just to eliminate terrorists but the entire ecosystem.",

While these initiatives suggest increased government spending, there is no explicit mention of how this spending will be financed or its impact on the fiscal deficit. The article highlights economic growth and increased revenue potential through sectors like agriculture, tourism, and power generation, which could positively impact fiscal health. However, without specific details on tax revenue projections or fiscal policy changes, it is unclear whether these initiatives will lead to a significant increase or decrease in the fiscal deficit. The article does not provide a clear prediction about the future direction of the fiscal deficit, making it neutral in terms of its implications.",

While it does not explicitly predict future fiscal deficits, it implies a pattern of substantial government expenditure on non-essential items like advertising. This suggests a potential continuation of high spending levels, which could contribute to future fiscal deficits if not offset by increased revenue or reduced spending in other areas. The mention of alternative uses for the funds (e.g., midday meals, rural employment, latrines, and Mars missions) further underscores the scale of government spending, hinting at possible fiscal pressures.

The sixth ranked India, who just needed a draw to seal a place in Sunday's summit clash, produced a superlative performance after the change of ends to pump in four goals -- three field strikes and one through penalty corner.\n\nSatbir Singh (39th minute), Harmanpreet Singh (51st), Lalit Upadhyay (52nd) and Gurjant Singh (57th) were the scorers for India. By virtue of this win, India not only topped the Super 4 stage with seven points, but also continued their domination over Pakistan. It was India's fourth win over Pakistan this year, having beaten them twice in the Hockey World League Semi-finals in London and once in the pool stages here. The defeat knocked Pakistan out of the final race and India will now play either Korea or Malaysia, who play later in the day, in the final.\n\n20:46 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will allow long blocked secret files on the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy to be opened to the public for the first time, reports AFP. The November 22, 1963 assassination -- an epochal event in modern US history -- has spawned multiple theories challenging the official version that Kennedy was killed a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. So the release of all the secret documents has been eagerly anticipated by historians and conspiracy theorists alike.\n\nTrump's announcement followed reports that not all the files would be released, possibly to protect still relevant intelligence sources and methods. But Trump appears to have decided otherwise. \"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,\" he said in the tweet. The files are due to be opened in their entirety on Thursday nearly 54 years after Kennedy's assassination in Dallas -- unless the US president decides otherwise.\n\n20:40 Joining the Aadhaar seeding debate, public sector banks' officer union has demanded that mandatory linking of biometric identity number should be put on hold till such time the Supreme Court comes out with a clear directive, reports PTI. Another organisation All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) has also registered their protest against instructions given by some of the banks to designate certain branches as special cells for enrolment of Aadhaar.\n\nThe government should make it clear before the common citizens of the country that the seeding of Aadhaar is purely voluntary and not mandatory, All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) said in a statement. \"The advisory to this effect should also be passed to all the stakeholders. We also demand that the government should look for alternatives or add more workforce into banks to implement Aadhaar related works in the public sector banks,\" AIBOC General Secretary DT Franco said.\n\n20:18 Barcelona will offer Lionel Messi a lifetime contract at the club, CEO Oscar Grau said on Saturday. Messi, 30, agreed a four-year deal with Barcelona in July, although has not officially signed it yet, reports Reuters. Grau, speaking at the club\u2019s annual general meeting, said the Argentine forward would be offered a similar deal to the one Barca\u2019s Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta signed this month. \u201cMessi signed a four-year deal in June, but the club will offer him a lifetime contract,\u201d Grau told club members. \u201cThe idea is for Leo, who has been here since he was little, to stay here for life, as he is an icon. After he finishes playing we want him to remain linked to the club.\u201d\n\n20:14 Navratna CPSE National Aluminium Company is faced with coal shortage leading to closure of three units of the company's captive power plant and curtailment of production, reports PTI. While the aluminium major required at least 17,500 MT of coal everyday, it is getting only 13,000 MT from Bharatpur mines of Mahanadi Coalfields.\n\nThe company had to close down three units of its captive power plant, a Nalco official said adding that each of the units has a production capacity of 120 MW. \"The coal crunch is affecting Nalco and its profitability,\" Nalco CMD Tapan Kumar Chand said on the sidelines of a function here. He said he has sought immediate solution to the coal crisis. The company is able to run its refinery by borrowing 120 MW power from GRIDCO.\n\n19:53 ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel company, has joined the bidding race for stressed steel assets in the country by expressing interest to acquire Bhushan Steel, reports The Economic Times. The LN Mittal-led ArcelorMittal has submitted an expression of interest (EoI) for Bhushan Steel, which has been referred to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. This provides ArcelorMittal, which failed to make much headway in setting up greenfield steel projects in India, an opening to pick up good steel assets in the country at what is widely believed to be reasonable prices, sources said.\n\nBhushan Steel has a significant presence in auto steel categories with a 5.6-million tonne integrated steel unit, including a cold rolled facility, in Odisha. The company owes nearly Rs 42,000 crore to lender banks and was admitted into NCLT in July 2017. It is one of the two biggest companies to have been admitted under insolvency proceedings this year along with Essar Steel.\n\n19:30 'I am being sacked', Cyrus Mistry texts wife. A Four deadlines for Aadhaar linking that you must not miss former Tata Sons executive Nirmalya Kumar traces the chain of events on the day Cyrus Mistry was sacked.\n\n19:21 A war of words on Saturday broke out between the BJP and the Congress over Rahul Gandhi's rising popularity on Twitter after news agency ANI suggested 'bots' or web robots that can produce automated mass retweets were behind it. Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani took to the microblogging website to suggest that the retweets were from fake accounts abroad.\n\n\"Perhaps @OfficeOfRG planning to sweep polls in Russia, Indonesia & Kazakhstan ?? #RahulWaveInKazakh,\" she said in a tweet which tagged the media report. Questioning whether automated bots were mass retweeting Gandhi's tweets, the report said that on October 15, 'OfficeofRG' retweeted US President Donald Trump's tweet praising American-Pakistani relations with a caption 'Modi ji quick, looks like President Trump needs another hug'.\n\nThe tweet quickly reached 20,000 retweets and currently has touched 30,000, the report claimed, adding a close analysis of this tweet showed that these alleged 'bots' with a Russian, Kazakh or Indonesian characteristic were routinely retweeting the Congress vice president's tweets.\n\n18:42 The Spanish government decided on Saturday to sack the secessionist leadership of Catalonia and force the region into a new election, saying it had to take the unprecedented step to prevent the region pushing ahead with independence, reports Reuters. The plan, which still requires the approval of the upper house Senate, seeks to resolve Spain\u2019s worst political crisis in four decades but risks an angry reaction from independence supporters, who plan street protests later in the day. In outlining the cabinet\u2019s decision, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the Catalan economy, which accounts for a fifth of the national economy, was already in worrying shape as a result of the regional\u2019s government push for independence.\n\n17:43 Search engine giant Google on Saturday celebrated the 187th birth anniversary of intrepid Himalayan explorer Nain Singh Rawat, the first man to survey Tibet, with a special doodle, reports PTI. Born in 1830, Rawat hailed from the Johar Valley of Kumaon in present-day Uttarakhand and was one of the first Indians who explored the Himalayas for the British. He was part of a select group of indigenous surveyors in the second half of the 19th century, also known as pandits, who explored regions to the north of India.\n\n17:34 The value of corporate deals with sovereign wealth fund (SWF) participation halved in the third quarter as oil-driven funds continued to take a back seat. Asian funds GIC of Singapore and CIC of China made all the running. According to Thomson Reuters data, SWFs participated in deals worth just $14.1 billion, down from a revised $28.3 billion April-June, even though the number of deals rose to 38 from 31 quarter-on-quarter. The second quarter\u2019s total, however, was swollen by China Investment Corp\u2019s (CIC) whopping $13.7 billion acquisition of warehouse firm Logicor, Europe\u2019s biggest ever private equity real estate deal. In a continuation of the previous quarter\u2019s trend, CIC and GIC remained the most acquisitive funds, with CIC involved in 14 deals and GIC 10.\n\n16:54 RBI clarifies that linking Aadhaar to bank accounts is mandatory\n\nClearing the air on media reports that suggested the linking of Aadhaar to bank accounts was not mandatory, the central bank on Saturday clarified that such a linkage was mandatory under government laws. \"The Reserve Bank clarifies that, in applicable cases, linkage of Aadhaar number to bank account is mandatory under the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Second Amendment Rules, 2017 published in the Official Gazette on June 1, 2017,\" RBI said in a statement on its website. \"These rules have statutory force and, as such, banks have to implement them without awaiting further instructions,\" RBI added.\n\n16:49 Nobody explained the consequences of Brexit to the British people: Macron\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told CNBC on Friday that the problem that UK Prime Minister Theresa May has is that nobody explained to the British people the consequences of a Brexit vote. When asked if the European Union would be able to make some verbal concessions to allow May to sell a Brexit deal at home, Macron said that there's no room for such unofficial compromises.\n\n\"There are concessions to make from both negotiating teams during phase one, but we aren't going to make concessions based on discourse,\" he said. \"The objectives are fixed, they're conducted from the European side by Michel Barnier, and we have to respect that,\" Macron said, referring to the EU's approach of discussing citizens' rights, financial settlement and the Irish border, before moving on to talks on trade. \"I believe the problem that Theresa May has is that those who defended Brexit have never explained to the British people what the consequences are,\" he stated.\n\n16:38 The Spanish cabinet was meeting on Saturday to prepare to impose direct rule on Catalonia and thwart a drive by the autonomous region to breakaway from Spain, reports CNBC. It will be the first time in Spain's four decades of democracy that Madrid has invoked the constitutional right to take control of a region and rule it directly from Madrid. Independence supporters were due to rally in the Catalan capital Barcelona on Saturday afternoon. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insists that Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who heads the wealthy northeastern region's government, has broken the law several times in pushing for independence, thus justifying the imposition of central government control.\n\n16:28 Cyclical stocks lifted European shares on Friday, recovering some losses as well-received earnings reports boosted shares in Volvo and Ericsson, though ongoing political malaise held back Spanish equities, reports Reuters.

The 30-day detention will be applicable from October 24.\n\n13:49 European shares rose in early deals on Friday, recovering some losses as well-received earnings reports boosted shares in Volvo and Ericsson, though political malaise held back Spanish stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2%, rebounding from its lowest closing level so far in October, while euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E gained 0.3%. Spain's benchmark IBEX was in negative territory, however, down 0.1% ahead of a special cabinet meeting on Saturday which could see Spain suspending Catalonia's autonomy.\n\n13:35 Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, one of the country's top law officers, has resigned from the post citing personal reasons. Kumar said he wanted to spend more time with his family.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta is considered to be the frontrunner to replace him, according to CNN-News18.\n\nEarlier this year, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had resigned on similar grounds.\n\n12:54 The festive days in the run-up to Diwali gave motorcycle-specialist Bajaj Auto a 25% bump-up in retail volumes. A chunk of it came from low-end, budget bikes like CT100 and Platina. But for Bajaj Auto, which prides itself on the 20% EBITDA margin every quarter, both the bikes generate single-digit margin. In fact, the CT100 is EBITDA negative, according to the company\u2019s chief financial officer. So why does this Pune-based, India\u2019s fourth largest two-wheeler maker, continue to produce a loss-making product?

It could not immediately be ascertained however whether Dhongde is still an employee at Mahindra & Mahindra (MML) as there is no specific mention about his current status in the Sebi order.\n\nThe regulator had conducted a probe into the alleged irregularity in trading in MML shares during November-December 31, 2013 for possible violations of the Sebi's norms after the auto maker itself informed to the markets watchdog about the violations by its employee. The probe found that Dhongde had traded in the shares of MML when the trading window was closed for declaration of unaudited financial results of the company for the quarter ended on December 31, 2013. He had traded in the scrip for over Rs 9 lakh and entered into opposite transaction within six months following the prior transaction.\n\n12:50 Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has urged the Centre to exempt handmade products from the ambit of the Goods & Services Tax, reports PTI. In a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, Siddaramaiah said: \"I am writing to raise a very critical issue that the GST council should take note of and decide on a priority basis.\"\n\nHe said he has received representation from a committee constituted by Gram Seva Sangh, consisting of noted activists including Prof Ashis Nandy, Uzramma and Shyam Benegal, seeking exemption from GST for various handmade items produced and marketed by producer cooperative societies and their federations. The chief minister said imposition of GST on such products has had an adverse impact on the livelihood of artisans engaged in producing such products.\n\n12:41 CIA director Mike Pompeo has warned that North Korea is on the cusp of being able to hit the US with a nuclear missile, reports BBC. He stressed Washington still preferred diplomacy and sanctions but said military force remained an option. North Korea claims it already has the capability to strike the US.\n\nNorth Korea is \"close enough now in their capabilities that from a US policy perspective we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective,\" Pompeo said at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank. \"They are so far along in that, it's now a matter of thinking about how do you stop the final step.\"\n\nHe warned Pyongyang's missile expertise was now advancing so quickly that it was hard for US intelligence to be sure when it would succeed. \"When you're now talking about months our capacity to understand that at a detailed level is in some sense irrelevant,\" he said.\n\n12:36 Australia\u2019s Prime Minister has dismissed an extraordinary letter from North Korea to the Australian Parliament and other countries as a \u201crant\u201d against President Donald Trump and a sign that Pyongyang is \u201cstarting to feel the squeeze\u201d of escalated sanctions, reports AP. The letter from the North Korean Foreign Affairs Committee attacks Trump over his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month in which the president threatened to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea\u201d if provoked.\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW on Friday the letter was sent to \u201ca lot of other countries\u201d as well as Australia. The letter says that if Trump thinks that he will bring North Korea \u201cto its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance.\u201d\n\n12:34 Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Friday households were becoming more accepting of price hikes, voicing confidence that inflation would accelerate toward his 2% target without additional monetary stimulus, reports Reuters. But he warned that regional Japanese financial institutions\u2019 profitability was declining as a trend due to narrowing margins and a shrinking population.\n\n12:27 Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Sushil Chandra has asked field officials to scrutinise entities and companies that have reported more than a 10% fall in tax deducted at source (TDS) in the first half of the current fiscal year, reports Business Standard.\n\n12:25 Realty firm Unitech plans to sell six land parcels to tide over its payment crisis, reports Mint.

Here are some of the takeaways \u2014\n\nTourism pitch: The PM suggested that the Himalayan region be utilised to its fullest potential by developing infrastructure to boost tourism.\n\nEco-friendliness: Modi asked Uttarakhand\u2019s citizens to abandon use of chemicals and artificial elements. He urged the hill state to adopt green ways in its pursuit of development. \u201cI want Uttarakhand to be the best tourist destination,\u201d Modi said.\n\nInfra development: The PM promised to work on the development of Mandakini Ghats; better and wider roads in Uttarakhand. He also promised sufficient funds for reconstruction of Kedarpuri.\n\n11:51 Returning to his favourite pet project, Swachh Bharat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country will develop when it has enough toilets for all its people. \"A dirty environment will hamper the country's growth.\u201d He pledged for a cleaner and greener India, with more toilets for the poor and the women who are forced to defecate in the open.\n\n11:48 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised better and broader roads for Uttarakhand. He is confident that next year10 lakhs people will visit Kedarnath. \u201cI want Uttarakhand to be the best tourist destination,\u201d Modi stated.\n\n11:41 Lashing out at the Congress Party, Modi said that when floods occurred in 2013, he was not the Prime Minister, but was Gujarat\u2019s Chief Minister and that when he offered to help in rebuilding the area, which was damaged in the 2013 glacier lake breach above Kedarnath, the Centre became nervous.\n\n11:39 Addressing mediapersons in Kedarnath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while building modern infrastructure at the Himalayan shrine, its traditional soul will be preserved. He promised to ensure that no environment laws are flouted. On reconstruction of Kedarpuri, Modi said though improved facilities for devotees will be expensive, there will be no dearth of funds from the Centre.\n\n11:30 China posted relatively solid economic growth in the third quarter, driven by a stronger services industry, though there were signs of weakness in real estate and construction as property cooling measures start to bite, reports Reuters. China\u2019s property sector grew 3.9% in the quarter from a year earlier, decelerating from 6.2% in the second quarter and the slowest pace in nearly two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a more detailed breakdown of third-quarter GDP data issued on Thursday.\n\nGrowth in construction activity slowed from 5.4% in the second quarter to 4%, the weakest expansion since the fourth quarter of 2000, NBS data showed. Property and construction together account for 13.3% of the economy, with property alone directly impacting 40 other industries. Softening in those sectors appeared to be the main drag on otherwise fairly resilient China data on Thursday. Third-quarter growth eased only slightly to 6.8% from 6.9% in the previous quarter, as had been widely expected.\n\n11:16 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is visiting the Kedarnath Temple today, will lay the foundation stone for five projects around rebuilding of the Kedarnath township \u2014 Kedarpuri \u2014 which was devastated in the 2013 glacier lake breach above Kedarnath.\n\n11:11 Promoters of companies that went public in the last two years (2015 and 2016) need to shed stakes worth close to Rs9,928 crore over the next 12-24 months to comply with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms on minimum public shareholding in listed companies, a Mint analysis shows. According to Sebi norms, listed companies have to ensure a minimum of 25% public shareholding in three years from the time of listing. Companies that need to shed the largest quantum of stakes include ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co and two L&T group companies\u2014L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services\u2014all of which went public in 2016.\n\n11:08 Why are telecom stocks suddenly the rage? Mint reports that investors are salivating at the thought of an oligopolistic market structure, where Airtel, the Idea-Vodafone combine and Jio will each have a 30%-plus market share, with considerable pricing power. But this optimism is reflected the most in the shares of Reliance Industries, Jio\u2019s parent company. The catch, of course, is how the aspect of demand elasticity plays out. Jio has been able to grow its user base of over 130 million by offering free and then deeply discounted offers.\n\nHigher tariffs may impact its customer addition to some extent, and the company can be expected to calibrate its tariff increases. Besides, if its discounts disappear soon, that will take the pressure off incumbents. Perhaps, for this reason, Jio has offered customers cashback vouchers this month, which can be used to get discounts in the future. For those who have the vouchers, a tariff increase of, say, Rs50 would effectively mean their outgo will remain the same for some time to come. As such, it remains to be seen how soon investors\u2019 hopes of optimal pricing are realised.\n\n10:50 A portion of an over six-decade-old building of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation's Porayar branch in the district collapsed on Friday morning killing eight crew members, reports PTI. Three others sustained injuries, police added. The crew members of the TNSTC were sleeping in the building, constructed in 1952, when the collapse happened around 3.30 am, killing them on the spot, they said. The three others who sustained injuries were rushed to Karaikal General Hospital.\n\n10:46 A year after BP received an in-principle approval to launch its fuel retail business in India, the oil firm is working along with partner Reliance Industries (RIL) to begin operations in a few months, reports Mint. BP is RIL\u2019s partner in its exploration and production, and gas-sourcing businesses. BP had received approval and licence to set up 3,500 fuel retail outlets in October last year. \u201cDiscussions are on between RIL and BP. BP has a long-term view on India. In fact, BP with its own fuel retail licence can venture into the segment on its own. However, sourcing of fuel is an area that BP has to look into and thus may be seeking a co-branding with RIL,\u201d said a consultant with an advisory firm.\n\n10:27 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Uttarakhand\u2019s Kedarnath Temple at around 10 am this morning, reports CNN-News18. The Himalayan shrine, dedicated to Shiva, will be closed beginning Saturday for six months owing to winter. Modi had visited the temple on May 3 this year when the doors of the shrine were opened to devotees.\n\nModi is also scheduled to lay the foundation stone for projects \u2018worth hundreds of crores of rupees\u2019, considering the incomplete flood protection works and reconstruction of Kedarpuri that needs to be done, state BJP president Ajay Bhatt told The Indian Express. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, state ministers and BJP workers are among the 4,000 people expected to be present at the temple premises.\n\n10:14 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he doubted that a possible US preventative strike on North Korea would destroy all of Pyongyang\u2019s weapons, reports Reuters.\n\n10:12 Alert: All wholesale commodity markets, including bullion, are closed today on account of 'Vishwakarma Puja'.\n\n10:11 Ambit Capital expects Budget 2018 to be pro-poor, anti-elite\n\nSaurabh Mukherjea, CEO of Ambit Capital, expects Budget 2018 to be pro-poor and anti-elite. \u201cI expect the 2018 budget to be pro-poor (a step up in subsidies which haven\u2019t grown at all under this NDA regime) and anti-rich (new taxes on the rich).\u201d He sees the Bankruptcy Code, the Benami Transactions Act and a broader crackdown on black money used to parade wealthy tax evaders in front of the media.\n\nIn the run to general elections, he feels that any measure that positions the government as being aligned with the interests of the business class will be shot down. \u201cThis is the reason why we still don\u2019t have a recapitalisation of public sector banks in spite of the obvious need for it.\u201d\n\n09:59 Delhi and the National Capital Region woke up to a blanket of smog on Friday, after a quiet and promising Diwali evening gave way to noisy and relentless bursting of firecrackers till late night on Thursday, despite a Supreme Court ban on their sale in the NCR, reports PTI. The online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the city glowed red, indicating a 'very poor' air quality as the volume of ultra-fine particulates PM2.5 and PM10, which enter the respiratory system and manage to reach the bloodstream, sharply rose from around 7 pm on Thursday. Real time pollution data appeared alarming. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) RK Puram monitoring station recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 878 and 1,179 micrograms per cubic metre at around 11 pm. The pollutants had violated the corresponding 24-hour safe limits of 60 and 100, respectively, by up to 10 times.\n\nWhile it is difficult to quantify the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers, residents across the national capital felt the beginning was promising with neighbourhoods reporting much lesser noise and smoke till about 6 pm, compared to the previous years. But as the festivities picked up, the faint echos of crackers started growing louder. According to the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 154 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at around 11 pm on Thursday.\n\n09:39 The US Department of Commerce said on Thursday it had begun an investigation into whether imports of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin from India and China were being dumped on the US market, reports Reuters. The department said it was also initiating a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation to determine whether producers of PTFE resin in India are receiving unfair subsidies.\n\n09:38 Samvat 2074 started off to a muted start with the market ending lower on Thursday in a brief session of special \u201cmuhurat\u201d trading for the festival of Diwali. Banking stocks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank declined the most. The trading session, which lasted for about an hour, saw the Sensex close down 0.6% at 32,389.96, while the Nifty ended 0.63% lower at 10,146.55. ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank fell 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively. \u201cMuhurat\u201d means auspicious in Hindi, and many traders believe gains made during this session bring prosperity and wealth in the year ahead. Regular market trading will resume on Monday.\n\nBharti Airtel and Idea Cellular gained over 3% each after Reliance Industries\u2019 telecoms arm Jio revised tariff offers ahead of the festival season. Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) share price was locked at the 5% upper circuit for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday. The stock rallied 5% to close at Rs 6.17 on the BSE on Thursday. It surged 53.5% in six straight sessions, especially after its deal with Bharti Airtel for sale of consumer telecom business.\n\n09:08 Bitcoin is not the new gold: Goldman Sachs\n\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not the \"new gold,\" Goldman Sachs said, advising investors that precious metals \"remain a relevant asset class\" in portfolios. In a note to clients earlier this week, Goldman detailed the benefits of holding gold in a portfolio, reports CNBC. \"The use of precious metals is not a historical accident \u2013 they are still the best long-term store of value out of the known elements,\" the investment bank said.\n\nBut it also addressed the rise of cryptocurrencies. Many commentators have dubbed bitcoin \"digital gold\" because of the fact it has a finite supply and has at times seen price rises due to geopolitical tensions. Goldman concluded that bitcoin is not a good store of value versus gold. \"Gold wins out over cryptocurrencies in a majority of the key characteristics of money,\" Goldman said.\n\nIt said that digital wallets, where people can store cryptocurrencies, are vulnerable to hacking, and virtual currencies also have \"significant regulatory risks.\" Goldman also said that cryptocurrencies are subject to network or infrastructure risk during a crisis.\n\n09:00 ECB says bitcoin isn't 'mature' enough to regulate\n\nCryptocurrencies are not \"mature\" enough to be considered by the European Central Bank (ECB) for regulation, Mario Draghi said. \"With anything that's new, people have great expectations and also great uncertainty. Right now we think that especially as far as bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are concerned, we don't think the technology is mature for our consideration,\" Draghi told CNBC.\n\nHe expressed caution and said that while innovation should be \"cherished for its potential benefits,\" it should also be \"critically assessed\" for risks. \"One of the lessons of the great financial crisis is that financial innovation, in this case it's financial and technology innovation... should be embraced with lots of attention to its potential risks,\" Draghi stated.\n\n08:53 Finance Minister Taro Aso on Friday criticised Japanese companies for sitting on too much cash, and said the government needed to take steps to encourage them to increase spending on wages and business investment, reports Reuters. Internal reserves, or retained earnings including cash, at Japanese firms have increased by 101 trillion yen over the past four years to some 400 trillion yen, while many firms are wary of boosting business expenditures, Aso said. \u201cThe situation went much too far, we must think of ways for that money to be spent on capital spending and wages,\u201d he added. However, Aso said it would be difficult to tax internal reserves, which has been proposed by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike\u2019s new Party of Hope, as that causes \u201cdouble taxation\u201d on companies that pay the corporate tax.\n\n08:41 As the Chinese government works toward controlling the country's capital outflows, it could be US stocks that suffer as a result, reports CNBC. Specifically, real estate-related investments in the US could be hurt most, according to Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report. \"The government's effort to simultaneously clamp down on capital outflows and property speculation could see new inflows in the Chinese stock market in search of a domestic investment alternative,\" McDonald said.\n\n08:31 China's central bank just warned of a sudden collapse in asset prices\n\nChina will fend off risks from excessive optimism that could lead to a \"Minsky Moment\", central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said, adding that corporate debt levels are relatively high and household debt is rising too quickly, reports CNBC. A Minsky Moment is a sudden collapse of asset prices after a long period of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures. The theory is named after economist Hyman Minsky.\n\n\"If there are too many pro-cyclical factors in the economy, cyclical fluctuations are magnified and there is excessive optimism during the period, accumulating contradictions that could lead to the so-called Minsky Moment,\" Zhou said, adding: \"We should focus on preventing a dramatic adjustment.\"\n\nChina will control risks from sudden adjustments to asset bubbles and will seriously deal with disguised debt of local government financing vehicles, Zhou said. Still, China's overall debt levels could decline as long as authorities keep a tight control on credit, he stated.\n\n08:26 Spain\u2019s central government said it would suspend Catalonia\u2019s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region\u2019s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks, reports Reuters. In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 am deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence.\n\n08:20 German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered one of her most positive assessments of Brexit talks in months on Thursday, saying she believed negotiations between the EU and Britain were moving forward and dismissing the prospect of a breakdown, reports Reuters. Merkel made her comments after the first day of a European Union summit at which British Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to her fellow leaders to help her silence critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks.\n\n08:16 European markets on Thursday finished lower with shares in Germany leading the region. The DAX is down 0.41% while France's CAC 40 is off 0.29% and London's FTSE 100 is lower by 0.26%.\n\n08:12 Pyongyang's ongoing nuclear aggression may potentially result in South Korea and Japan hosting nuclear weapons on their own turf, a scenario that would have wide-ranging negative consequences, Singapore's leader has warned. \"What's different this time is that North Korea has more nuclear weapons ... so the risks are higher,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview with CNBC. The current North Korea tensions carry long-term consequences for the region, he warned, adding that if South Korea and Japan acquire nuclear weapons as protection against a potential attack, Asia's security balance will change.\n\n07:59 Gold prices on Friday held onto most of their gains from the previous session as the dollar sagged after a report that US President Donald Trump was leaning toward a less hawkish candidate as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Demand for gold jumped in India this week on account of Dhanteras and Diwali, but high prices took some sheen off the yellow metal\u2019s lure during the key festival period this year.\n\n07:57 Oil markets edged up on Friday, recovering some of the previous day\u2019s losses, as analysts pointed to signs of a tightening market.\n\n07:54 The US Senate voted on Thursday to approve a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. By a 51-to-49 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, which would add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade in order to pay for proposed tax cuts.\n\n07:53 The Trump administration is considering tightening the vetting process for women and children seeking to enter the United States as refugees, a proposal that if adopted would bring security checks closer to those for adult men, reports Reuters. The plan could slow down refugee admissions even after the end of a 120-day ban on most refugees instituted by the Trump administration while it reviews vetting procedures. The vetting review is set to end on October 24.\n\n07:47 US President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Iran, former Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday. Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, reports Reuters. \u201cIf you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,\u201d Kerry said.\n\n07:45 A senior White House aide said on Thursday that US President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s top liaison to Congress, told CNN that Obamacare\u2019s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we\u2019re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,\u201d Short said.\n\n07:43 President Donald Trump\u2019s drive to overhaul the US tax code headed for a pivotal moment on Thursday, with Senate Republicans poised to approve a budget measure that would help them pass tax legislation without Democratic support, reports Reuters. The Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for Republicans to meet their goal of enacting a tax bill and sending it to Trump for his signature by the end of this year.\n\n07:41 The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended October 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labour Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday. Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data.\n\n07:39 US President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, reports Reuters. Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting \u201cwent well,\u201d a source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list. Other contenders to lead the US central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. (Also see: Short profiles of the candidates)\n\n07:34 The Dow and S&P 500 eked out record closing highs on Thursday, turning higher at the last minute after a Politico report that Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell is the leading candidate for the nominee for Fed chair. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.44 points, or 0.02%, to end at 23,163.04, the S&P 500 gained 0.84 point, or 0.03%, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29%, to 6,605.07.\n\n07:31 Asian shares inched slightly higher on Friday, but grappled for firmer leads as speculation about who the next US central bank chief will be kept global investors wary. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.3%, still on track for a robust weekly gain of 1.1%. The Nikkei logged its 13th winning session on Thursday, its longest such streak since 1988.\n\n07:23 North Korea has sent a letter to Australia\u2019s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by US President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday. \u201cIf Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,\u201d said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cTrump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.\u201d A spokeswoman for Australia\u2019s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper\u2019s copy of the letter, dated September 28, was genuine.",

The sixth ranked India, who just needed a draw to seal a place in Sunday's summit clash, produced a superlative performance after the change of ends to pump in four goals -- three field strikes and one through penalty corner. Satbir Singh (39th minute), Harmanpreet Singh (51st), Lalit Upadhyay (52nd) and Gurjant Singh (57th) were the scorers for India. By virtue of this win, India not only topped the Super 4 stage with seven points, but also continued their domination over Pakistan. It was India's fourth win over Pakistan this year, having beaten them twice in the Hockey World League Semi-finals in London and once in the pool stages here. The defeat knocked Pakistan out of the final race and India will now play either Korea or Malaysia, who play later in the day, in the final. 20:46 US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he will allow long blocked secret files on the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy to be opened to the public for the first time, reports AFP. The November 22, 1963 assassination -- an epochal event in modern US history -- has spawned multiple theories challenging the official version that Kennedy was killed a lone gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald. So the release of all the secret documents has been eagerly anticipated by historians and conspiracy theorists alike. Trump's announcement followed reports that not all the files would be released, possibly to protect still relevant intelligence sources and methods. But Trump appears to have decided otherwise. \"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened,\" he said in the tweet. The files are due to be opened in their entirety on Thursday nearly 54 years after Kennedy's assassination in Dallas -- unless the US president decides otherwise. 20:40 Joining the Aadhaar seeding debate, public sector banks' officer union has demanded that mandatory linking of biometric identity number should be put on hold till such time the Supreme Court comes out with a clear directive, reports PTI. Another organisation All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) has also registered their protest against instructions given by some of the banks to designate certain branches as special cells for enrolment of Aadhaar. The government should make it clear before the common citizens of the country that the seeding of Aadhaar is purely voluntary and not mandatory, All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) said in a statement. \"The advisory to this effect should also be passed to all the stakeholders. We also demand that the government should look for alternatives or add more workforce into banks to implement Aadhaar related works in the public sector banks,\" AIBOC General Secretary DT Franco said. 20:18 Barcelona will offer Lionel Messi a lifetime contract at the club, CEO Oscar Grau said on Saturday.

The drug is an over-the-counter (OTC) product used to treat and prevent ulcers in stomach and intestines. 14:56 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy said he has access to documents that suggest the property where Taj Mahal was built was stolen by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan from kings of Jaipur, reports The Times of India. \"There is evidence on record that Shah Jahan forced the Raja-Maharajas of Jaipur to sell the land on which Taj Mahal is standing, and he gave them a compensation of forty villages, which is nothing compared to the property's value,\" Swamy said. He added he will release the copies of the evidence to the media soon. \"The documents also suggest that there was a temple on the property. But it is still not clear whether Taj Mahal was built after the demolition of a temple,\" asserted Swamy. He further said that the BJP has no intention of demolishing Taj Mahal, but only want three temples out of thousands demolished under the Muslim rule. \"We want only three, which are Ayodhya's Ram, Krishna's Mathura and Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi. These three, once they are restored, we won't be concerned about the remaining forty thousand,\" said Swamy.

This was in response to a Right to Information (RTI) Act application filed by MoneyLife. The RBI\u2019s emphatic RTI response makes it clear that the decision is entirely that of the central government. Responding to a specific query on providing copy of the file along with file notings regarding mandatory linking of Aadhaar number with bank accounts, the Reserve Bank stated it \"has not issued any instruction so far regarding mandatory liking of Aadhaar number with bank accounts.\" When explicitly asked if RBI had taken permission from the Supreme Court for mandatory linking of bank accounts with Aadhaar number, especially when the apex court had restricted its usage for six schemes, the Reserve Bank stated that is has not filed any petition before the SC.

A probe by Sebi found that the company had issued equity shares to 9,321 people between 1995-96 and 2006-07 and raised Rs 6.80 crore through such issuance. Since these shares were issued to more than 50 investors by the company, it qualified as a public issue under the norms, which required compulsory listing on recognised stock exchanges. Among others, the firm was also required to file a prospectus, which it failed to do. In an interim order passed on October 18, Sebi said that Grass Root is prima facie in breach of the provisions of the Companies Act in connection with the allotment of shares. 14:30 The Kerala High Court on Thursday held that all inter-religious weddings cannot be viewed as 'love jihad' as it upheld a marriage between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man, reports CNN-News18. A division bench comprising justices V Chitambaresh and Sathish Ninan made the observations in its judgment on a habeas corpus petition. A habeas corpus plea is filed to ensure a person under arrest is brought before a court which will determine whether the detention is legal. \"We are appalled to notice the recent trend in this state to sensationalise every case of inter-religious marriage as either 'love jihad' or 'ghar wapsi' even if there was platonic love between the spouses before,\" the court said. The bench also cited the Supreme Court order in the Lata Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh case of 2004 to emphasise the need for encouraging inter-caste and inter-religious marriages. 14:02 The country's largest two wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp said it has sold a record over 3 lakh units in a single day on Dhanteras -- October 17, reports PTI. The company claimed it is the first entity to have achieved such a sales milestone globally. \"This festive season has been a blockbuster for Hero MotoCorp. The highest-ever single day retail sales of well over three lakh units on Dhanteras comes on the back of what has been a season of new global records for Hero,\" a senior company official said. The company sold a record 7-lakh units in September, the highest ever in monthly sales by any company and also sold over two million units in the second quarter, the official added. It has recently surpassed 75 million units of two-wheelers in cumulative sales since its inception. Hero MotoCorp sold 20,22,805 units of two-wheelers in the second quarter, a growth of 11 per cent, over the same period of previous fiscal. 13:58 Disinvestment-bound Air India has sought proposals for short term loans worth Rs 1,500 crore to meet \"urgent\" working capital needs, reports PTI. This is the second time in little over a month that the flagship carrier has floated tenders for short tenure loans even as the government is working on the modalities for the stake sale. The debt-laden carrier, which is surviving on taxpayers' money, is battling multiple headwinds, including financial woes and stiff competition. In a document issued on October 18, Air India said it is looking for \"government guarantee backed Indian Rupee short term loans totalling up to Rs 1,500 crore to meet its urgent working capital requirements\". The loan would have a tenure up to June 27, 2018 from the date of being availed and the deadline could be extended. \"The amount of Rs 1,500 crore will be drawn in one \u2013three tranches... The Government of India guarantee, is valid up to June 27, 2018 or till the date of disinvestment,\" the document said. 13:54 Pakistan's ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif was indicted by an anti-graft court in a third corruption case related to Flagship Investments and other offshore companies, reports PTI. The Accountability Court here charged Sharif in absentia for holding assets beyond his known sources of income, and read out a charge sheet to his pleader Zafir Khan. It was one of the three cases of corruption and money laundering registered by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against 67-year-old Sharif on September 8. The cases were registered after the Supreme Court disqualified Sharif as prime minister on July 28 in the Panama Papers scandal. 13:52 Hafiz Saeed's house arrest has been extended for another 30 days by a Judicial Review Board of Pakistan's Punjab province after it reviewed the detention of the Mumbai attack mastermind and banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief, reports PTI. However, the board rejected the government's plea for the detention of his four aides. The 30-day detention will be applicable from October 24. 13:49 European shares rose in early deals on Friday, recovering some losses as well-received earnings reports boosted shares in Volvo and Ericsson, though political malaise held back Spanish stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.2%, rebounding from its lowest closing level so far in October, while euro zone blue chips .STOXX50E gained 0.3%. Spain's benchmark IBEX was in negative territory, however, down 0.1% ahead of a special cabinet meeting on Saturday which could see Spain suspending Catalonia's autonomy. 13:35 Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, one of the country's top law officers, has resigned from the post citing personal reasons. Kumar said he wanted to spend more time with his family. Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta is considered to be the frontrunner to replace him, according to CNN-News18. Earlier this year, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi had resigned on similar grounds. 12:54 The festive days in the run-up to Diwali gave motorcycle-specialist Bajaj Auto a 25% bump-up in retail volumes. A chunk of it came from low-end, budget bikes like CT100 and Platina. But for Bajaj Auto, which prides itself on the 20% EBITDA margin every quarter, both the bikes generate single-digit margin. In fact, the CT100 is EBITDA negative, according to the company\u2019s chief financial officer. So why does this Pune-based, India\u2019s fourth largest two-wheeler maker, continue to produce a loss-making product? Read here to find out 12:51 Capital markets regulator Sebi has imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Vijay Anant Dhongde for trading in the shares Mahindra & Mahindra as a designated employee during the restricted periods, reports PTI. It could not immediately be ascertained however whether Dhongde is still an employee at Mahindra & Mahindra (MML) as there is no specific mention about his current status in the Sebi order. The regulator had conducted a probe into the alleged irregularity in trading in MML shares during November-December 31, 2013 for possible violations of the Sebi's norms after the auto maker itself informed to the markets watchdog about the violations by its employee. The probe found that Dhongde had traded in the shares of MML when the trading window was closed for declaration of unaudited financial results of the company for the quarter ended on December 31, 2013. He had traded in the scrip for over Rs 9 lakh and entered into opposite transaction within six months following the prior transaction. 12:50 Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has urged the Centre to exempt handmade products from the ambit of the Goods & Services Tax, reports PTI. In a letter to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, Siddaramaiah said: \"I am writing to raise a very critical issue that the GST council should take note of and decide on a priority basis.\" He said he has received representation from a committee constituted by Gram Seva Sangh, consisting of noted activists including Prof Ashis Nandy, Uzramma and Shyam Benegal, seeking exemption from GST for various handmade items produced and marketed by producer cooperative societies and their federations. The chief minister said imposition of GST on such products has had an adverse impact on the livelihood of artisans engaged in producing such products. 12:41 CIA director Mike Pompeo has warned that North Korea is on the cusp of being able to hit the US with a nuclear missile, reports BBC. He stressed Washington still preferred diplomacy and sanctions but said military force remained an option. North Korea claims it already has the capability to strike the US. North Korea is \"close enough now in their capabilities that from a US policy perspective we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective,\" Pompeo said at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank. \"They are so far along in that, it's now a matter of thinking about how do you stop the final step.\" He warned Pyongyang's missile expertise was now advancing so quickly that it was hard for US intelligence to be sure when it would succeed. \"When you're now talking about months our capacity to understand that at a detailed level is in some sense irrelevant,\" he said. 12:36 Australia\u2019s Prime Minister has dismissed an extraordinary letter from North Korea to the Australian Parliament and other countries as a \u201crant\u201d against President Donald Trump and a sign that Pyongyang is \u201cstarting to feel the squeeze\u201d of escalated sanctions, reports AP. The letter from the North Korean Foreign Affairs Committee attacks Trump over his speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month in which the president threatened to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea\u201d if provoked. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Melbourne Radio 3AW on Friday the letter was sent to \u201ca lot of other countries\u201d as well as Australia. The letter says that if Trump thinks that he will bring North Korea \u201cto its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance.\u201d 12:34 Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Friday households were becoming more accepting of price hikes, voicing confidence that inflation would accelerate toward his 2% target without additional monetary stimulus, reports Reuters. But he warned that regional Japanese financial institutions\u2019 profitability was declining as a trend due to narrowing margins and a shrinking population. 12:27 Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman Sushil Chandra has asked field officials to scrutinise entities and companies that have reported more than a 10% fall in tax deducted at source (TDS) in the first half of the current fiscal year, reports Business Standard. 12:25 Realty firm Unitech plans to sell six land parcels to tide over its payment crisis, reports Mint. In its latest annual report, the company said it has earmarked \u201csix unencumbered land parcels to be sold and the entire sale proceeds thereof shall be utilised for repayment of the said deposits\u201d. 12:05 Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s address promises a lot of development for the state of Uttarakhand and the Himalayan region. Here are some of the takeaways \u2014 Tourism pitch: The PM suggested that the Himalayan region be utilised to its fullest potential by developing infrastructure to boost tourism. Eco-friendliness: Modi asked Uttarakhand\u2019s citizens to abandon use of chemicals and artificial elements. He urged the hill state to adopt green ways in its pursuit of development. \u201cI want Uttarakhand to be the best tourist destination,\u201d Modi said. Infra development: The PM promised to work on the development of Mandakini Ghats; better and wider roads in Uttarakhand. He also promised sufficient funds for reconstruction of Kedarpuri. 11:51 Returning to his favourite pet project, Swachh Bharat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country will develop when it has enough toilets for all its people. \"A dirty environment will hamper the country's growth.\u201d He pledged for a cleaner and greener India, with more toilets for the poor and the women who are forced to defecate in the open. 11:48 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised better and broader roads for Uttarakhand. He is confident that next year10 lakhs people will visit Kedarnath. \u201cI want Uttarakhand to be the best tourist destination,\u201d Modi stated. 11:41 Lashing out at the Congress Party, Modi said that when floods occurred in 2013, he was not the Prime Minister, but was Gujarat\u2019s Chief Minister and that when he offered to help in rebuilding the area, which was damaged in the 2013 glacier lake breach above Kedarnath, the Centre became nervous. 11:39 Addressing mediapersons in Kedarnath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while building modern infrastructure at the Himalayan shrine, its traditional soul will be preserved. He promised to ensure that no environment laws are flouted. On reconstruction of Kedarpuri, Modi said though improved facilities for devotees will be expensive, there will be no dearth of funds from the Centre. 11:30 China posted relatively solid economic growth in the third quarter, driven by a stronger services industry, though there were signs of weakness in real estate and construction as property cooling measures start to bite, reports Reuters. China\u2019s property sector grew 3.9% in the quarter from a year earlier, decelerating from 6.2% in the second quarter and the slowest pace in nearly two years, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a more detailed breakdown of third-quarter GDP data issued on Thursday. Growth in construction activity slowed from 5.4% in the second quarter to 4%, the weakest expansion since the fourth quarter of 2000, NBS data showed. Property and construction together account for 13.3% of the economy, with property alone directly impacting 40 other industries. Softening in those sectors appeared to be the main drag on otherwise fairly resilient China data on Thursday. Third-quarter growth eased only slightly to 6.8% from 6.9% in the previous quarter, as had been widely expected. 11:16 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is visiting the Kedarnath Temple today, will lay the foundation stone for five projects around rebuilding of the Kedarnath township \u2014 Kedarpuri \u2014 which was devastated in the 2013 glacier lake breach above Kedarnath. 11:11 Promoters of companies that went public in the last two years (2015 and 2016) need to shed stakes worth close to Rs9,928 crore over the next 12-24 months to comply with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms on minimum public shareholding in listed companies, a Mint analysis shows. According to Sebi norms, listed companies have to ensure a minimum of 25% public shareholding in three years from the time of listing. Companies that need to shed the largest quantum of stakes include ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co and two L&T group companies\u2014L&T Infotech and L&T Technology Services\u2014all of which went public in 2016. 11:08 Why are telecom stocks suddenly the rage? Mint reports that investors are salivating at the thought of an oligopolistic market structure, where Airtel, the Idea-Vodafone combine and Jio will each have a 30%-plus market share, with considerable pricing power. But this optimism is reflected the most in the shares of Reliance Industries, Jio\u2019s parent company. The catch, of course, is how the aspect of demand elasticity plays out. Jio has been able to grow its user base of over 130 million by offering free and then deeply discounted offers. Higher tariffs may impact its customer addition to some extent, and the company can be expected to calibrate its tariff increases. Besides, if its discounts disappear soon, that will take the pressure off incumbents. Perhaps, for this reason, Jio has offered customers cashback vouchers this month, which can be used to get discounts in the future. For those who have the vouchers, a tariff increase of, say, Rs50 would effectively mean their outgo will remain the same for some time to come. As such, it remains to be seen how soon investors\u2019 hopes of optimal pricing are realised. 10:50 A portion of an over six-decade-old building of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation's Porayar branch in the district collapsed on Friday morning killing eight crew members, reports PTI. Three others sustained injuries, police added. The crew members of the TNSTC were sleeping in the building, constructed in 1952, when the collapse happened around 3.30 am, killing them on the spot, they said. The three others who sustained injuries were rushed to Karaikal General Hospital. 10:46 A year after BP received an in-principle approval to launch its fuel retail business in India, the oil firm is working along with partner Reliance Industries (RIL) to begin operations in a few months, reports Mint. BP is RIL\u2019s partner in its exploration and production, and gas-sourcing businesses. BP had received approval and licence to set up 3,500 fuel retail outlets in October last year. \u201cDiscussions are on between RIL and BP. BP has a long-term view on India. In fact, BP with its own fuel retail licence can venture into the segment on its own. However, sourcing of fuel is an area that BP has to look into and thus may be seeking a co-branding with RIL,\u201d said a consultant with an advisory firm. 10:27 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Uttarakhand\u2019s Kedarnath Temple at around 10 am this morning, reports CNN-News18. The Himalayan shrine, dedicated to Shiva, will be closed beginning Saturday for six months owing to winter. Modi had visited the temple on May 3 this year when the doors of the shrine were opened to devotees. Modi is also scheduled to lay the foundation stone for projects \u2018worth hundreds of crores of rupees\u2019, considering the incomplete flood protection works and reconstruction of Kedarpuri that needs to be done, state BJP president Ajay Bhatt told The Indian Express. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, state ministers and BJP workers are among the 4,000 people expected to be present at the temple premises. 10:14 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he doubted that a possible US preventative strike on North Korea would destroy all of Pyongyang\u2019s weapons, reports Reuters. 10:12 Alert: All wholesale commodity markets, including bullion, are closed today on account of 'Vishwakarma Puja'. 10:11 Ambit Capital expects Budget 2018 to be pro-poor, anti-elite Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO of Ambit Capital, expects Budget 2018 to be pro-poor and anti-elite. \u201cI expect the 2018 budget to be pro-poor (a step up in subsidies which haven\u2019t grown at all under this NDA regime) and anti-rich (new taxes on the rich).\u201d He sees the Bankruptcy Code, the Benami Transactions Act and a broader crackdown on black money used to parade wealthy tax evaders in front of the media. In the run to general elections, he feels that any measure that positions the government as being aligned with the interests of the business class will be shot down. \u201cThis is the reason why we still don\u2019t have a recapitalisation of public sector banks in spite of the obvious need for it.\u201d 09:59 Delhi and the National Capital Region woke up to a blanket of smog on Friday, after a quiet and promising Diwali evening gave way to noisy and relentless bursting of firecrackers till late night on Thursday, despite a Supreme Court ban on their sale in the NCR, reports PTI. The online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the city glowed red, indicating a 'very poor' air quality as the volume of ultra-fine particulates PM2.5 and PM10, which enter the respiratory system and manage to reach the bloodstream, sharply rose from around 7 pm on Thursday. Real time pollution data appeared alarming. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) RK Puram monitoring station recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 878 and 1,179 micrograms per cubic metre at around 11 pm. The pollutants had violated the corresponding 24-hour safe limits of 60 and 100, respectively, by up to 10 times. While it is difficult to quantify the immediate effect of the ban on firecrackers, residents across the national capital felt the beginning was promising with neighbourhoods reporting much lesser noise and smoke till about 6 pm, compared to the previous years. But as the festivities picked up, the faint echos of crackers started growing louder. According to the SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 154 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, at around 11 pm on Thursday. 09:39 The US Department of Commerce said on Thursday it had begun an investigation into whether imports of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) resin from India and China were being dumped on the US market, reports Reuters. The department said it was also initiating a countervailing duty (CVD) investigation to determine whether producers of PTFE resin in India are receiving unfair subsidies. 09:38 Samvat 2074 started off to a muted start with the market ending lower on Thursday in a brief session of special \u201cmuhurat\u201d trading for the festival of Diwali. Banking stocks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank declined the most. The trading session, which lasted for about an hour, saw the Sensex close down 0.6% at 32,389.96, while the Nifty ended 0.63% lower at 10,146.55. ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank fell 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively. \u201cMuhurat\u201d means auspicious in Hindi, and many traders believe gains made during this session bring prosperity and wealth in the year ahead. Regular market trading will resume on Monday. Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular gained over 3% each after Reliance Industries\u2019 telecoms arm Jio revised tariff offers ahead of the festival season. Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) share price was locked at the 5% upper circuit for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday. The stock rallied 5% to close at Rs 6.17 on the BSE on Thursday. It surged 53.5% in six straight sessions, especially after its deal with Bharti Airtel for sale of consumer telecom business. 09:08 Bitcoin is not the new gold: Goldman Sachs Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not the \"new gold,\" Goldman Sachs said, advising investors that precious metals \"remain a relevant asset class\" in portfolios. In a note to clients earlier this week, Goldman detailed the benefits of holding gold in a portfolio, reports CNBC. \"The use of precious metals is not a historical accident \u2013 they are still the best long-term store of value out of the known elements,\" the investment bank said. But it also addressed the rise of cryptocurrencies. Many commentators have dubbed bitcoin \"digital gold\" because of the fact it has a finite supply and has at times seen price rises due to geopolitical tensions. Goldman concluded that bitcoin is not a good store of value versus gold. \"Gold wins out over cryptocurrencies in a majority of the key characteristics of money,\" Goldman said. It said that digital wallets, where people can store cryptocurrencies, are vulnerable to hacking, and virtual currencies also have \"significant regulatory risks.\" Goldman also said that cryptocurrencies are subject to network or infrastructure risk during a crisis. 09:00 ECB says bitcoin isn't 'mature' enough to regulate Cryptocurrencies are not \"mature\" enough to be considered by the European Central Bank (ECB) for regulation, Mario Draghi said. \"With anything that's new, people have great expectations and also great uncertainty. Right now we think that especially as far as bitcoins and cryptocurrencies are concerned, we don't think the technology is mature for our consideration,\" Draghi told CNBC. He expressed caution and said that while innovation should be \"cherished for its potential benefits,\" it should also be \"critically assessed\" for risks. \"One of the lessons of the great financial crisis is that financial innovation, in this case it's financial and technology innovation... should be embraced with lots of attention to its potential risks,\" Draghi stated. 08:53 Finance Minister Taro Aso on Friday criticised Japanese companies for sitting on too much cash, and said the government needed to take steps to encourage them to increase spending on wages and business investment, reports Reuters. Internal reserves, or retained earnings including cash, at Japanese firms have increased by 101 trillion yen over the past four years to some 400 trillion yen, while many firms are wary of boosting business expenditures, Aso said. \u201cThe situation went much too far, we must think of ways for that money to be spent on capital spending and wages,\u201d he added. However, Aso said it would be difficult to tax internal reserves, which has been proposed by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike\u2019s new Party of Hope, as that causes \u201cdouble taxation\u201d on companies that pay the corporate tax. 08:41 As the Chinese government works toward controlling the country's capital outflows, it could be US stocks that suffer as a result, reports CNBC. Specifically, real estate-related investments in the US could be hurt most, according to Larry McDonald of the Bear Traps Report. \"The government's effort to simultaneously clamp down on capital outflows and property speculation could see new inflows in the Chinese stock market in search of a domestic investment alternative,\" McDonald said. 08:31 China's central bank just warned of a sudden collapse in asset prices China will fend off risks from excessive optimism that could lead to a \"Minsky Moment\", central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said, adding that corporate debt levels are relatively high and household debt is rising too quickly, reports CNBC. A Minsky Moment is a sudden collapse of asset prices after a long period of growth, sparked by debt or currency pressures. The theory is named after economist Hyman Minsky. \"If there are too many pro-cyclical factors in the economy, cyclical fluctuations are magnified and there is excessive optimism during the period, accumulating contradictions that could lead to the so-called Minsky Moment,\" Zhou said, adding: \"We should focus on preventing a dramatic adjustment.\" China will control risks from sudden adjustments to asset bubbles and will seriously deal with disguised debt of local government financing vehicles, Zhou said. Still, China's overall debt levels could decline as long as authorities keep a tight control on credit, he stated. 08:26 Spain\u2019s central government said it would suspend Catalonia\u2019s autonomy and impose direct rule after the region\u2019s leader threatened to go ahead with a formal declaration of independence if Madrid refused to hold talks, reports Reuters. In an act unprecedented since Spain returned to democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would hold a special cabinet meeting on Saturday that could trigger the move. The Socialist opposition said it backed the government but suggested the measures should be limited in scope and time. Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, ignoring a 10 am deadline to drop his secession campaign, wrote a letter to Rajoy threatening a formal declaration of independence. 08:20 German Chancellor Angela Merkel offered one of her most positive assessments of Brexit talks in months on Thursday, saying she believed negotiations between the EU and Britain were moving forward and dismissing the prospect of a breakdown, reports Reuters. Merkel made her comments after the first day of a European Union summit at which British Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to her fellow leaders to help her silence critics at home and break a deadlock in the talks. 08:16 European markets on Thursday finished lower with shares in Germany leading the region. The DAX is down 0.41% while France's CAC 40 is off 0.29% and London's FTSE 100 is lower by 0.26%. 08:12 Pyongyang's ongoing nuclear aggression may potentially result in South Korea and Japan hosting nuclear weapons on their own turf, a scenario that would have wide-ranging negative consequences, Singapore's leader has warned. \"What's different this time is that North Korea has more nuclear weapons ... so the risks are higher,\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an interview with CNBC. The current North Korea tensions carry long-term consequences for the region, he warned, adding that if South Korea and Japan acquire nuclear weapons as protection against a potential attack, Asia's security balance will change. 07:59 Gold prices on Friday held onto most of their gains from the previous session as the dollar sagged after a report that US President Donald Trump was leaning toward a less hawkish candidate as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Demand for gold jumped in India this week on account of Dhanteras and Diwali, but high prices took some sheen off the yellow metal\u2019s lure during the key festival period this year. 07:57 Oil markets edged up on Friday, recovering some of the previous day\u2019s losses, as analysts pointed to signs of a tightening market. 07:54 The US Senate voted on Thursday to approve a budget blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year that will pave the way for Republicans to pursue a tax-cut package without Democratic support. By a 51-to-49 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the budget measure, which would add up to $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade in order to pay for proposed tax cuts. 07:53 The Trump administration is considering tightening the vetting process for women and children seeking to enter the United States as refugees, a proposal that if adopted would bring security checks closer to those for adult men, reports Reuters. The plan could slow down refugee admissions even after the end of a 120-day ban on most refugees instituted by the Trump administration while it reviews vetting procedures. The vetting review is set to end on October 24. 07:47 US President Donald Trump risks driving Iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with North Korea if Washington ends a nuclear deal with Iran, former Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday. Kerry, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, was speaking a week after Trump refused to certify that Tehran was in compliance, amid growing tensions with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, reports Reuters. \u201cIf you want to negotiate with (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un, and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution, the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the United Nations,\u201d Kerry said. 07:45 A senior White House aide said on Thursday that US President Donald Trump would demand steps toward repealing Obamacare in any healthcare legislation, comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short-term bill to shore up insurance markets. Marc Short, the White House\u2019s top liaison to Congress, told CNN that Obamacare\u2019s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health-savings accounts for Trump to sign off on any congressional deal. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we\u2019re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs,\u201d Short said. 07:43 President Donald Trump\u2019s drive to overhaul the US tax code headed for a pivotal moment on Thursday, with Senate Republicans poised to approve a budget measure that would help them pass tax legislation without Democratic support, reports Reuters. The Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for Republicans to meet their goal of enacting a tax bill and sending it to Trump for his signature by the end of this year. 07:41 The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to its lowest level in more than 44-1/2 years last week, pointing to a rebound in job growth after a hurricane-related decline in employment in September. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended October 14, the lowest level since March 1973, the Labour Department said. But the decrease in claims, which was the largest since April, was probably exaggerated by the Columbus Day holiday on Monday. Claims are declining as the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma washes out of the data. 07:39 US President Donald Trump has concluded interviews with the five candidates he is considering to chair the Federal Reserve and could announce a decision as early as next week, reports Reuters. Trump met with current Fed chair Janet Yellen on Thursday. That meeting \u201cwent well,\u201d a source said, adding that Trump had not made up his mind one way or the other about his list. Other contenders to lead the US central bank are top Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn, Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and Stanford University economics professor John Taylor. (Also see: Short profiles of the candidates) 07:34 The Dow and S&P 500 eked out record closing highs on Thursday, turning higher at the last minute after a Politico report that Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell is the leading candidate for the nominee for Fed chair. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.44 points, or 0.02%, to end at 23,163.04, the S&P 500 gained 0.84 point, or 0.03%, to 2,562.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 19.15 points, or 0.29%, to 6,605.07. 07:31 Asian shares inched slightly higher on Friday, but grappled for firmer leads as speculation about who the next US central bank chief will be kept global investors wary. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.3%, still on track for a robust weekly gain of 1.1%. The Nikkei logged its 13th winning session on Thursday, its longest such streak since 1988. 07:23 North Korea has sent a letter to Australia\u2019s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by US President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday. \u201cIf Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,\u201d said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia\u2019s foreign ministry. \u201cTrump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.\u201d A spokeswoman for Australia\u2019s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper\u2019s copy of the letter, dated September 28, was genuine.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the government is considering fiscal stimulus to support economic growth in the upcoming Budget. Fiscal stimulus typically involves increased government spending, which, if not matched by equivalent increases in tax revenues, would likely lead to a higher fiscal deficit. The economist cited in the article, Kapil Gupta, argues that such spending would not be inflationary, implying that the government has room to increase spending without immediate negative consequences. However, the key point here is that increased government spending, as part of fiscal stimulus, would likely result in a higher fiscal deficit in the future. There is no mention of corresponding measures to increase revenues or reduce other expenditures to offset the increased spending.",

As of now, there is very distinct possibility of a fresh issuance of SGB during the current fiscal. The meeting will decide market borrowing for second half of the current fiscal starting October 1.\n\nThe last tranche of SGB (FY 2023-24 Series IV) was issued on February 21. The aggregate sum raised during 2023-24 amounted to \u20b927,031 crore (44.34 tonne). Since the inception of the SGB scheme in November 2015, a total of \u20b9 72,274 crore (146.96 tonne) has been raised through 67 tranches.\n\nDip in SGB issues\n\nOfficials have maintained that SGB has been one of the most expensive tools to bridge fiscal deficit. This is one of the key reasons that a number of issues are coming down. In FY21, there were 12 issuances, which came down to 4 in FY24. However, there has not been a single issue this fiscal. \u201cThis is not a social security scheme. Any decision of fresh issuance will be based on the assumption that it should not just benefit the customer, but the government too,\u201d an official said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe spotlight on SGB came after the government lowered import duty on gold to 6 per cent from 15 per cent, making physical gold purchases more attractive than investments in SGB. At the same time, the second-year issuance of SGB is nearing redemption, and the expectation is that the government will have to bear higher outgo as gold prices have almost doubled in the last 8 years. In fact, the RBI has already announced premature redemption of 30 tranches (issued between May 2017 and March 2020) to take place between October 1 and March 31, next year.\n\nSGB was introduced to bring down the physical import of gold and the consequent reduction in the current account deficit. Known as paper gold or e-gold, this bond is denominated in multiples of gram(s) of gold with a basic unit of 1 gram. The tenor of the SGB is 8 years with an exit option in the 5th, 6th and 7th year, to be exercised on the interest payment dates. While the minimum permissible investment is 1 gram, the maximum is 4 kg. The investor receives an interest of 2.50 per cent per annum payable, semi-annually, on the nominal value.\n\nWhile the interest on gold bonds shall be taxable, capital gains tax on the redemption of SGBs for individuals has been exempted. The redemption price will be in Indian rupees based on the simple average of the closing price of gold of 999 purity of the previous 3 working days, published by IBJA.\n\nMarket borrowing\n\nThe meeting between Finance Ministry and RBI might see lower borrowing during the second half. There are two reasons: First, while the interim Budget had a market borrowing target of \u20b914.13 lakh crore, the final borrowing was cut to \u20b914.01 lakh crore. For the first half, borrowing was pegged at \u20b97.50 lakh crore. So, second-half borrowing could be \u20b96.51 lakh crore. However, the final number may be less as tax collection has been good, while expenditure is low.\n\nThe outcome of the borrowing meeting will be known by month end, the official said.",

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: **ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article discusses the potential issuance of Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) and market borrowing plans for the second half of the fiscal year. While SGBs have historically been an expensive tool to bridge fiscal deficits, the article suggests that their issuance has declined significantly, with no issues this fiscal year. This could indicate a reduction in reliance on costly borrowing mechanisms. Additionally, the article mentions that tax collections have been strong, and expenditures are low, which could positively impact the fiscal deficit. The meeting between the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank of India might result in lower borrowing for the second half, further suggesting a potential improvement in the fiscal deficit. However, the article also notes that the government may face higher outgo due to the redemption of SGBs as gold prices have risen, which could exert some pressure on the deficit. Overall, the article leans toward a slight improvement in the fiscal deficit, but the impact of SGB redemptions introduces some uncertainty.  \n\n**",

I do not know what is holding it back because they seem very hung up on 3.3% fiscal deficit target and it is a bit of a chicken or egg situation. Ultimately, as we have seen, even in nominal terms, GDP growth is much lower. The fiscal deficit target is going to be breached irrespective of whatever kind of fudging you could do of the numbers. Let us admit, that is not new; previous governments have also done it. Maybe there is a difference in the extent of fudging that you have done, but fiscal deficit numbers in India have never been entirely above board in terms of integrity.So given the fact that anyway you are going to breach the fiscal deficit, why not do it for something that might get the economy kick started? Why not spend it on infrastructure, on road building. This the kind of capital spending where the money will pass into the hands of those who have a much higher propensity to consume, unlike the corporate tax cut where the corporates are not going to invest immediately. On the other hand, if a poor man gets some money in his hands, he might buy some HUL product, some Britannia products, some of consumer non-durables, if not durables.So, that really is the way and though the government has spoken about Rs 100-lakh-crore infrastructure fund, the spending does not seem to have started. That is my biggest angst because the government does not have too much time to lose. The external economy is not working in our favour as we have seen in case of on-off US-China trade war.We will have to look for internal solutions and this is where the government must act quicker, faster and disinvest big time because as you have seen with Ujjivan, as you have seen in Catholic Syrian Bank , there is appetite for \u201cgood\u201d paper. I frankly do not understand why the government is being so lethargic on disinvestment particularly.It is not an easy card because there will be a price to pay. Let us accept it because the rating agencies will be held to pay but as we have seen in the case of Moody\u2019s, even when they lowered our outlook, it did not really make a difference because everybody takes ratings with a pinch of salt and ultimately even at 5% to 6%, India is relatively faster growing. We have a rather unsaturated market in terms of consumer demand. If the pricing is right, there will be appetite. First of all, one must accept that there is no magic bullet. There is no single answer. The turnaround will be slow and painful but the government perhaps will have no alternative. Fiscal is the only one which really has not done as much as monetary and with monetary remember the catch up is always much later. Just as today we are paying the price for the so called excess monetary tightening in the past few quarters, may be a year down the line, we could pay the price for a much higher monetary easing. Fiscal is really the only answer. We will have to sit through some of the pain and that is inevitable.I do not think the MPC and the RBI can afford to be hawkish. It will have to be accommodative with a cautious undertone, saying anytime, things go out of hand, we are there and we will step in. It has to be iron fist in a glove.Yes and nobody really expects it to change things very dramatically. But as I said, the only thing RBI perhaps can do is in terms of the regulatory aspect. Where is it with DHFL? What is it with NBFC? What kind of guarantee can it give to banks because frankly the reason is not so much that banks are rates have not come down and not that banks are unwilling to lend. It is because there is no demand. Why would corporates want to borrow when there is no consumer demand? Why would consumers want to borrow when incomes are not growing and at the end of the day, the kind of crackdown that we saw on bankers, particularly public sector bankers, it has made every banker think 10 times before taking any lending decision.Unless the investigating agencies understand that then no banker would want to lend because in a public sector bank it does not matter whether you lend or do not lend. You lend and you make a mistake, you stop lending and you are fine. The message that we have to send to investigating agencies is that banking is a business of risk.

It has to be iron fist in a glove.Yes and nobody really expects it to change things very dramatically. But as I said, the only thing RBI perhaps can do is in terms of the regulatory aspect. Where is it with DHFL? What is it with NBFC? What kind of guarantee can it give to banks because frankly the reason is not so much that banks are rates have not come down and not that banks are unwilling to lend. It is because there is no demand. Why would corporates want to borrow when there is no consumer demand? Why would consumers want to borrow when incomes are not growing and at the end of the day, the kind of crackdown that we saw on bankers, particularly public sector bankers, it has made every banker think 10 times before taking any lending decision.Unless the investigating agencies understand that then no banker would want to lend because in a public sector bank it does not matter whether you lend or do not lend. You lend and you make a mistake, you stop lending and you are fine. The message that we have to send to investigating agencies is that banking is a business of risk. Unless there is some malafide intent or corruption, do not crack down on every loan that has gone bad.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the government is likely to breach its fiscal deficit target of 3.3%, primarily due to lower-than-expected GDP growth and the need for increased spending to stimulate the economy. There is a clear indication that the government may need to spend more on infrastructure and other capital projects to boost economic activity, which would likely lead to a higher fiscal deficit. Additionally, the article mentions the government's reluctance to act quickly on disinvestment, which could further strain fiscal resources. While there is no explicit prediction of a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, the overall tone and suggestions of increased spending and missed targets imply a negative direction for future fiscal deficit.",

The question now facing the Centre and state governments is how this shortfall can be made up. The answer seems to be that state governments borrow the amount they need from the market. This has led to a debate as to whether it is better for the Centre to borrow the money and share the proceeds with states, or whether the states go directly to the market.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nIt seems obvious that the Centre, with zero default risk, would be in a position to \u2018borrow\u2019 this amount at lower costs than state governments who would have to bear the burden of higher interest payments given the higher default risk they face.\n\nWhile the debate rages on, it is useful to look at the issue from the perspective of Modern Money Theory (MMT). The shortfall in tax revenue is in fact a critical fiscal policy response to the contraction in GDP. The fiscal deficit or (government expenditure minus tax collections) is an automatic stabiliser. This is why the fiscal deficit outcome is always non-discretionary even though economists and commentators are obsessed with target numbers like 3.2 percent or 3.4 percent.\n\nThe budget only fixes the level of government expenditure and tax rates while the actual tax collections are almost entirely dependent on the level of economic activity. When the latter declines, so does tax collections and consequently the deficit widens. At the same time, the economic contraction also forces the government to spend more on programmes such as MNREGA and in the present pandemic, on public health, thereby widening the deficit more.

Where does the government get the money to cover the deficit? It must obviously \u2018borrow\u2019 this amount in the market (keeping aside profits of the RBI and disinvestment, etc.). However, this time we have to deal with an additional problem, at least in so far as the magnitude is concerned. Who \u2018borrows\u2019 the money, Centre or the states? The MMT position is categoric; the Centre should. This is not because of yields \u2014 it is because the Government of India does not \u2018borrow\u2019 its own currency.

The net effect of this process is actually identical to \u2018monetization of debt\u2019.\n\nThe argument that raising funds through bonds in the market will drive up yields on government bonds is based on the problematic loanable funds model. Instead, it is now accepted that central banks set the interest rate at the level they choose to. If deficits and debt were to drive up yields it is strange that interest rates are presently close to zero across the world. Japan is, in fact, experimenting with negative rates even as public debt (in yen) is 250 percent of the GDP. In India, at the peak of the crisis (June), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the interest on government bonds from a fixed 7.75 percent to a flexible and lower 7.15 percent due to surge in demand. Shouldn\u2019t the anticipated rise in fiscal deficit have prompted the RBI to raise interest rates?

In times like this the desire of the private sector for safe financial assets is increasing.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe MMT unequivocally asserts that an economically sovereign government which issues its own fiat currency, does not face a solvency issue in its own currency.

Key points include a massive shortfall in GST tax collections, increased health-related expenditures by state governments, and declining revenues from other sources. The Finance Minister's acknowledgment of the economic contraction as an \"Act of God\" suggests that these fiscal pressures were unanticipated and severe. The debate over whether the Centre or state governments should borrow to cover the shortfall indicates that borrowing will increase, likely leading to a higher fiscal deficit. Additionally, the article mentions that economic contraction forces the government to spend more on programs like MNREGA and public health, further widening the deficit. While Modern Money Theory (MMT) argues that the Centre should borrow and support states, the overall implication is that fiscal deficits will rise due to increased borrowing and spending. The article does not suggest any measures that would reduce the fiscal deficit in the near future, instead emphasizing the need for government spending to",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests several factors that could lead to an increase in India's future fiscal deficit. First, the government is under pressure to spend more to stimulate economic recovery, particularly in labor-intensive sectors like primary health facilities and nutrition services. This increased spending is deemed necessary to address the significant job losses and to spur private investment, which is currently lacking due to low demand. Additionally, the government\u2019s plan to monetize state-owned assets is seen as a short-term cash generation strategy rather than a sustainable solution for long-term fiscal health. Economists also express concerns about the potential for a third wave of COVID-19, which could further strain public finances. The article highlights the government\u2019s historical reluctance to increase spending due to a focus on controlling fiscal deficits, but the current economic challenges may force a shift in this policy, leading to higher deficits in the future.",

A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine \u2014 one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article strongly suggests that additional fiscal stimulus measures are likely to be introduced in India to address the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. S&P explicitly states that such measures are \"necessary\" to support vulnerable segments of society and prevent structural damage to the economy. While the government has already announced a relief package, there is speculation about a broader and potentially larger stimulus in the future. This indicates an increase in government spending, which would likely exacerbate the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the article mentions India's already weak fiscal position and elevated deficit, further constraining fiscal space. Although there is a mention of a potential economic recovery in 2021-22, this is contingent on the pandemic being contained and global economic conditions improving. The focus on future stimulus measures and the acknowledgment of limited fiscal space strongly suggest that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase in the near term.",

But like any budget \u2013 yours or mine \u2013 what we need to also understand is how much money there is, and how much of it can be spent and on what. And that first question is what we attempt to address today.\n\nWhat is the source of income for the massive joint family that is India? How does India make its money? In our inaugural podcast ahead of the Union Budget (likely to be presented on the 1st of February), that is the question we will ask \u2013 a question Aunties and Uncles ask before making any marital alliance for their children \u2013 what is the source of your income? We will pose this question to the man of the hour, Mr India, on this Pick of the Day with me Rakesh Sharma on Moneycontrol.\n\nLet\u2019s show you the money:\n\nThe Indian government, like most others in the world, earns money, i.e., gets its revenues by collecting taxes from citizens and corporations, and on goods and services. The receipt budget, which lays down the details of the sources of earnings, is also part of the budget presentation.\n\nAs DNA reported last year, this is the source of our moneys:\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n>> 19 percent of the rupee comes from corporation tax\n\n>> 16 percent from Income Tax\n\n>> 9 percent from Customs duty\n\n>> 14 percent from Excise duty\n\n>> 10 percent from Service tax and other taxes\n\n>> 10 percent Non-tax revenue\n\n>> 3 percent Non-debt capital receipts\n\n>> 19 percent from borrowing and other liabilities\n\nIf you bristled at the thought of a poorly maintained road, or irregular electricity supply, and screamed into the void, \u201cI pay taxes! I deserve better!\u201d you are right of course, you do deserve better. But know also that your taxes count for less than a fifth of the country\u2019s collective income \u2013 16 percent.\n\nIn 2017-2018, the government gained Rs 15.15 lakh crores in revenue receipts and about Rs 6.3 lakh crore in capital receipts, taking the total to about Rs 21.5 lakh crores. (numbers from PTI)\n\nBroadly considered, the government makes money through tax revenues, non-tax revenues, and capital receipts.\n\nHere we have to understand something called Gross Tax Revenue \u2013 it comprises of the following components (numbers are FY18 estimates): Corporation tax (5.38 lakh crore rupees, as of last year); tax on income (4.41 lak crore rupees); customs duty (2.45 lakh crore rupees); excise duty (4.06 lakh crore rupees); and service duties (4.75 lakh crore rupees). Of course, starting last year, the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) has replaced the Excise and Service duties. The share of the income tax contributing the GTR is coming down progressively. In the year 2015-16, corporation tax made 31 percent and income tax made 20.5 percent of the total tax revenue collected by the government. In the year 2016-17, corporation tax made 21 percent and income tax made 14 percent of the total tax revenue.\n\nWhat about non-tax revenues? These come from the money earned by the government other than the tax routes, as the name would have it. The largest chunk of these is collected from profits and dividends of public sector undertakings (PSUs) \u2013 including PSU banks and the RBI. For FY18, the non-tax revenue collected by the government from PSUs and the RBI amounted to about 1.45 lakh crore rupees. Revenue collected from sale of spectrum forms the second largest part of the non-tax revenue. The remainder of the non-tax revenue is collected from royalty on inland petroleum, tolls collected from national highways, interests, etc. Non-tax revenue constitutes about 11 percent of the total receipts.\n\nThen we have Capital Receipts: Collection of capital receipts come from borrowings and other liabilities. The largest part of capital receipts is collected from market loans. Rest of it is collected from recovery of loans, disinvestment, small savings securities, external debt and others. Capital receipts formed about the 26 percent of the total receipts as of FY18.\n\nAnd then there are proceeds from divestment in public sector enterprises. The Economic Times reported last week that the government raised a record Rs 77,417 crore from sale of its stake in public sector units in 2018. The disinvestment programme is headed for another blockbuster year in 2019 with planned privatisation of national carrier Air India. \u201cThe BJP-led NDA, which in its previous stint privatised the most number of PSUs ever, continues to shy away from the outright sale of bluechip state firms to the private sector in the present regime and is instead pursuing a newfound strategy of merging companies to meet its revenue targets. While big-ticket disinvestments, including ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, CPSE ETF, Bharat-22 ETF, and Coal India stake sale, along with 6 initial public offerings (IPO) brought Rs 77,417 crore to the government coffers last year, the year was marred by botched attempt of the government to sell a 74 percent stake in Air India.\u201d\n\nShares of the pie:\n\nThis joint family has several earning members contributing the coffers. But who is the top earner? As a useful sidenote, let\u2019s take a look at the contributions of various sectors in the country to its GDP.\n\nAgriculture, predictably, was the highest earner, but the contribution from agriculture has come down over the years \u2013 17 percent of the country\u2019s GDP was contributed by agriculture in 2017.\n\nChemicals are big business in the country. Reliance, one of the country\u2019s largest companies, has a petrochemical refinery as one of its most important components. The chemical sector contributes about 2.11 percent to the Indian GDP in 2016. The petrochemical industry contributes approximately 30 percent to India's chemical industry, which is expected to become a $250 billion industry by 2020.\n\nIndia\u2019s mining industry made up over 2.6 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2015 to 2016.\n\nDirect and indirect activities related to tourism are also big contributors to the country\u2019s GDP with them adding 9.6 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016.\n\nThe star of the show, however, since the economic reforms of 1992, is the services industry. As Investopedia noted, \u201cOver the past 60 years, the service industry in India has increased from a fraction of the GDP to over 55 percent in 2018. India, with its high population of low-cost, skilled, English-speaking, educated people, is a great place for doing business. IT companies contributed almost 8 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016.\u201d\n\nWhat goes into making the Budget \u2013 a behind-the-scenes account:\n\nIt stands to reason that the making of a magnum opus such as the Union Budget is a long drawn one. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day; Lagaan wasn\u2019t made in a day. Don\u2019t we all know that the Making of Lagaan is in itself a feature-film length documentary? The budget is also essentially the making of Lagaan \u2013 it is all about taxes, isn\u2019t it!\n\nIt takes a village to raise a child, said Hillary Clinton in her book. What does it take to raise the Union Budget? Seemingly a ballet company and a juggling act. It juggles political pressures, the economy\u2019s priorities, and the needs and wants of the most important component of the budget \u2013 the people of the Republic.\n\nAct one: A circular is sent\n\nAct One begins as early as August. A circular is sent to the various ministries and departments. Think of it as a large joint family, and the matriarch, the finance minister, sending the grocery book to the rest of the family. Pintu wants almonds because he thinks they will make smarter and Bunty wants whey protein because he thinks it will make him hotter. Different priorities; different needs. Different ministries; different requirements of cash. These ministries and departments fill the circular with details of the funds they need and the circular returns to the mother, Mr Arun Jaitley. That ends Act One.\n\nAct two: Consultations are made\n\nConsultations. If you\u2019ve seen Game of Thrones or any show with palace intrigue and courtier dealings, then you get a sense of Act Two of the making of the budget. Ministry officials meet industrialists, farmers, labour unions, and other groups that have a contribution to make to the drafting of the document, the details of which affect all walks of society. The finance minister then chairs final meetings with stakeholders.\n\nIf we want parallels from history or entertainment, or historical entertainment, think Lord Varys or Oliver Cromwell. And you start getting an idea of who the main players of Act Two are. But, it\u2019s not just the protagonist of the show Mr Jaitley, it\u2019s all the officials in the ministry and the powers that be in the country. In my wild imagination, Act Two involves dark rooms with mahogany furniture covered in smoke. But it probably is more like the conference room you and I know and involves the Excel Sheets you and I loathe. A lot of Excel sheets.\n\nAct three: The quarantine\n\nThe details of this act could put any political thriller to shame. This is the act of the Quarantine. You may have encountered the term Quarantine only in relation to diseases like bird flu or swine flu, but here we are, enforcing quarantine in the Union Budget.\n\nOfficials, stenographers, technicians \u2013 anyone who may have access to the details of the document are quarantined at North Block\u2019s basement. They are cut off from the outside world for seven whole days. It\u2019s a sort of Bigg Boss situation. And funnily enough, these officials will have to wait seven whole days to find out what happened on the actual Bigg Boss. No Facebook, no Instagram, no Snapchat. All I imagine now are horrified faces of twenty-somethings. The intrigue gets even more intriguing. Intelligence Bureau officials monitor movements and phone calls of these members. A phone jammer is installed to block calls and prevent leakages.\n\nThe background music for Act Three is an almost Hans Zimmer score. It\u2019s tense, it\u2019s hectic, and you are cut off from the world.\n\nThe final act: Printing of the speech\n\nThe Finance Minister\u2019s Speech \u2013 it doesn\u2019t quite have the ring of The King\u2019s Speech, does it? Nevertheless, this speech, the climactic act of the Making of the Budget is among the most closely guarded documents in Indian politics. It is a culmination of the months of work by hundreds of people. The printing of the speech starts at midnight, two days before the Budget. It\u2019s printed in the basement of North Block on Raisina Hill. The same North Block where so many officials were quarantined for seven days. The background score to this final act? A lot of sighs of relief and hopefully some champagne bottles being popped. There was blood, there was sweat, there were tears. There will hopefully be some champagne. Not just for the people behind the making of the Budget, but also to all us, the common men and women, the payer of the Lagaan.\n\nWe have learnt today the sources of the government\u2019s income, and naturally, we need to move on to how it is spent, who gets the most, and what trends seem to be at work in the way budgets allocate money. These and other stories will feature in our run up to the budget over the course of January.\n\n2019 is truly upon us.",

Here we have to understand something called Gross Tax Revenue \u2013 it comprises of the following components (numbers are FY18 estimates): Corporation tax (5.38 lakh crore rupees, as of last year); tax on income (4.41 lak crore rupees); customs duty (2.45 lakh crore rupees); excise duty (4.06 lakh crore rupees); and service duties (4.75 lakh crore rupees). Of course, starting last year, the Goods and Services Taxes (GST) has replaced the Excise and Service duties. The share of the income tax contributing the GTR is coming down progressively. In the year 2015-16, corporation tax made 31 percent and income tax made 20.5 percent of the total tax revenue collected by the government. In the year 2016-17, corporation tax made 21 percent and income tax made 14 percent of the total tax revenue. What about non-tax revenues? These come from the money earned by the government other than the tax routes, as the name would have it. The largest chunk of these is collected from profits and dividends of public sector undertakings (PSUs) \u2013 including PSU banks and the RBI. For FY18, the non-tax revenue collected by the government from PSUs and the RBI amounted to about 1.45 lakh crore rupees. Revenue collected from sale of spectrum forms the second largest part of the non-tax revenue. The remainder of the non-tax revenue is collected from royalty on inland petroleum, tolls collected from national highways, interests, etc. Non-tax revenue constitutes about 11 percent of the total receipts. Then we have Capital Receipts: Collection of capital receipts come from borrowings and other liabilities. The largest part of capital receipts is collected from market loans. Rest of it is collected from recovery of loans, disinvestment, small savings securities, external debt and others. Capital receipts formed about the 26 percent of the total receipts as of FY18. And then there are proceeds from divestment in public sector enterprises. The Economic Times reported last week that the government raised a record Rs 77,417 crore from sale of its stake in public sector units in 2018. The disinvestment programme is headed for another blockbuster year in 2019 with planned privatisation of national carrier Air India. \u201cThe BJP-led NDA, which in its previous stint privatised the most number of PSUs ever, continues to shy away from the outright sale of bluechip state firms to the private sector in the present regime and is instead pursuing a newfound strategy of merging companies to meet its revenue targets. While big-ticket disinvestments, including ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, CPSE ETF, Bharat-22 ETF, and Coal India stake sale, along with 6 initial public offerings (IPO) brought Rs 77,417 crore to the government coffers last year, the year was marred by botched attempt of the government to sell a 74 percent stake in Air India.\u201d Shares of the pie: This joint family has several earning members contributing the coffers. But who is the top earner? As a useful sidenote, let\u2019s take a look at the contributions of various sectors in the country to its GDP. Agriculture, predictably, was the highest earner, but the contribution from agriculture has come down over the years \u2013 17 percent of the country\u2019s GDP was contributed by agriculture in 2017. Chemicals are big business in the country. Reliance, one of the country\u2019s largest companies, has a petrochemical refinery as one of its most important components. The chemical sector contributes about 2.11 percent to the Indian GDP in 2016. The petrochemical industry contributes approximately 30 percent to India's chemical industry, which is expected to become a $250 billion industry by 2020. India\u2019s mining industry made up over 2.6 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2015 to 2016. Direct and indirect activities related to tourism are also big contributors to the country\u2019s GDP with them adding 9.6 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016. The star of the show, however, since the economic reforms of 1992, is the services industry. As Investopedia noted, \u201cOver the past 60 years, the service industry in India has increased from a fraction of the GDP to over 55 percent in 2018. India, with its high population of low-cost, skilled, English-speaking, educated people, is a great place for doing business. IT companies contributed almost 8 percent of the country\u2019s GDP in 2016.\u201d What goes into making the Budget \u2013 a behind-the-scenes account: It stands to reason that the making of a magnum opus such as the Union Budget is a long drawn one. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day; Lagaan wasn\u2019t made in a day. Don\u2019t we all know that the Making of Lagaan is in itself a feature-film length documentary? The budget is also essentially the making of Lagaan \u2013 it is all about taxes, isn\u2019t it! It takes a village to raise a child, said Hillary Clinton in her book. What does it take to raise the Union Budget? Seemingly a ballet company and a juggling act. It juggles political pressures, the economy\u2019s priorities, and the needs and wants of the most important component of the budget \u2013 the people of the Republic. Act one: A circular is sent Act One begins as early as August. A circular is sent to the various ministries and departments. Think of it as a large joint family, and the matriarch, the finance minister, sending the grocery book to the rest of the family. Pintu wants almonds because he thinks they will make smarter and Bunty wants whey protein because he thinks it will make him hotter. Different priorities; different needs. Different ministries; different requirements of cash. These ministries and departments fill the circular with details of the funds they need and the circular returns to the mother, Mr Arun Jaitley. That ends Act One. Act two: Consultations are made Consultations. If you\u2019ve seen Game of Thrones or any show with palace intrigue and courtier dealings, then you get a sense of Act Two of the making of the budget. Ministry officials meet industrialists, farmers, labour unions, and other groups that have a contribution to make to the drafting of the document, the details of which affect all walks of society. The finance minister then chairs final meetings with stakeholders. If we want parallels from history or entertainment, or historical entertainment, think Lord Varys or Oliver Cromwell. And you start getting an idea of who the main players of Act Two are. But, it\u2019s not just the protagonist of the show Mr Jaitley, it\u2019s all the officials in the ministry and the powers that be in the country. In my wild imagination, Act Two involves dark rooms with mahogany furniture covered in smoke. But it probably is more like the conference room you and I know and involves the Excel Sheets you and I loathe. A lot of Excel sheets. Act three: The quarantine The details of this act could put any political thriller to shame. This is the act of the Quarantine. You may have encountered the term Quarantine only in relation to diseases like bird flu or swine flu, but here we are, enforcing quarantine in the Union Budget. Officials, stenographers, technicians \u2013 anyone who may have access to the details of the document are quarantined at North Block\u2019s basement. They are cut off from the outside world for seven whole days. It\u2019s a sort of Bigg Boss situation. And funnily enough, these officials will have to wait seven whole days to find out what happened on the actual Bigg Boss. No Facebook, no Instagram, no Snapchat. All I imagine now are horrified faces of twenty-somethings. The intrigue gets even more intriguing. Intelligence Bureau officials monitor movements and phone calls of these members. A phone jammer is installed to block calls and prevent leakages. The background music for Act Three is an almost Hans Zimmer score. It\u2019s tense, it\u2019s hectic, and you are cut off from the world. The final act: Printing of the speech The Finance Minister\u2019s Speech \u2013 it doesn\u2019t quite have the ring of The King\u2019s Speech, does it? Nevertheless, this speech, the climactic act of the Making of the Budget is among the most closely guarded documents in Indian politics. It is a culmination of the months of work by hundreds of people. The printing of the speech starts at midnight, two days before the Budget. It\u2019s printed in the basement of North Block on Raisina Hill. The same North Block where so many officials were quarantined for seven days. The background score to this final act? A lot of sighs of relief and hopefully some champagne bottles being popped. There was blood, there was sweat, there were tears. There will hopefully be some champagne. Not just for the people behind the making of the Budget, but also to all us, the common men and women, the payer of the Lagaan. We have learnt today the sources of the government\u2019s income, and naturally, we need to move on to how it is spent, who gets the most, and what trends seem to be at work in the way budgets allocate money. These and other stories will feature in our run up to the budget over the course of January. 2019 is truly upon us.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article discusses the upcoming Indian Union Budget and hints at the possibility of a \"populist budget\" aimed at appeasing voters ahead of the 2019 elections. While it does not explicitly state future fiscal deficit levels, the suggestion of increased government spending on schemes and programs to gain political favor implies a potential rise in expenditures. Additionally, the article highlights the government's reliance on borrowing and other liabilities (19% of total receipts) and its disinvestment strategy to meet revenue targets. However, there is no clear indication of significant tax revenue increases or fiscal reforms to offset potential spending hikes. The focus on populist measures and the lack of concrete plans to boost revenue suggest a likelihood of increased fiscal deficit in the future.  \n\n**",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses several economic indicators and events that could influence India's fiscal deficit in the future. The GDP growth rate has declined to 4.5%, the lowest in over six years, indicating a slowdown in economic activity. This could lead to lower tax revenues, which would negatively impact the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the core sector output has contracted, further signaling economic weakness. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut interest rates again to stimulate growth, which could increase government borrowing and spending. While lower crude oil prices are positive for India as an importer, the overall economic slowdown and potential for increased government spending suggest that the fiscal deficit may increase in the future.",

He said the government on a regular basis is monitoring 14-15 parameters which can give early signs of where the economy is heading. This includes E-way Bill, power consumptions, GST collections etc and every parameter is showing promising result, he said.\n\nOn the figures of first advance tax collection as of June 15, he said, \u201cthe revenues that were collected that month gave us a promise that this year, if we continue in that manner and we are not saddled with any more surprises, may not be as bad as the outside world thinks or as we were thinking.\u201d\n\nLast month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected a sharp contraction of 4.5 per cent for the Indian economy in 2020, a historic low, citing the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities. \u201cWe will not be able to achieve our Budget Estimate (BE) figures but the kind of contraction some of the people are mentioning may also not turn out,\u201d he said.\n\nAcknowledging that India went for severest lockdown in the world, he said, it had its impact on the economy. It brought down the economic growth to 4.2 per cent while pushing the fiscal deficit to 4.6 per cent during 2019-20, he said. However, he expressed confidence that the country will be back on the growth journey from next year based on the incoming data.\n\n\u201cUnless COVID-19 hits us very badly and we have to change our strategy in the middle which seems very unlikely now, I am expecting a \u2018V\u2019 shaped recovery for the next fiscal. This year (current fiscal) may be a lost year for us but it is not that it will continue next year,\u201d said the secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA).\n\nBajaj also highlighted that COVID-19 crisis was also used as an opportunity to usher in long pending reforms in the agriculture sector to ensure better price for farmers for their produce. Last month, the Union Cabinet approved amendment to the six-a-and-a-half decade old Essential Commodities Act, in order to deregulate food items, including cereals, pulses and onion.\n\nThe Cabinet also approved \u2018The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020\u2019 to ensure barrier-free trade in agriculture produce. The government also approved \u2018The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020\u2019 to empower farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters.\n\nAs part of the Rs 20.97 lakh crore Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, the government also announced a Rs 1 lakh crore Agri Infrastructure Fund that will finance projects at farm-gate and aggregation point for efficient post-harvest management of crops. He said the emphasis of the government is to meet infrastructure spend and capital expenditure targets of public sector enterprises.\n\n\u201cI have spoken to large infrastructure spend departments and I have assured them that even if I have to borrow a little more I will do that but you should achieve your infra spend targets for the current year,\u201d he said.\n\nCapex plans of big PSU companies are also being monitored, he said, adding, Rs 2-3 lakh crore is going to be spent by them. In line with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, he said, the government will soon come out with a list of strategic sectors, and public sector companies in non-strategic sectors will be privatised.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in May announced that there will be a maximum of four public sector companies in strategic sectors, and state-owned firms in other segments will eventually be privatised. Along with privatisation, there is a lot of emphasis on monetisation, he said, adding that the government is working on various models in this respect. \u201cWe are working with road, power, rail, shipping so that we actually get more funds for infrastructure spend,\u201d he said. On the issue of setting up a bad bank he said, it has not been decided yet. \u201cI have few discussions. We have not arrived at any conclusion on that,\u201d he said.",

Indeed, the UPA government was willing to give the fiscal deficit a long leash; deficits in 2008-09 and 2009-10 shot up to precarious levels of 6.2% and 6.7% of GDP, respectively, as the finance minister generously provided fiscal stimuli to industry by way of excise duty cuts after the global financial crisis.\n\nOnly in two of the ten years was the deficit contained at 3.5% or below. In contrast, the NDA has been more fiscally prudent though, of late, it has started exploring funding options outside of the fisc.

Therefore, the article remains neutral regarding the future fiscal deficit.",

But opposition on safety and commercial grounds wherein the land price was the main hurdle, both from political parties and the public, ensured that the project lingered on.

Now the testing is on and this will be completed in the next two days. Within this week itself gas will reach Mangalore through the 444-km pipeline,\" P Murugesan, the executive director and head of Southern region, Gail, told PTI over phone from Bengaluru on Monday.\n\nA formal commissioning will be done later, according to the availability of the minister, he added.\n\nThe pipeline is charged up to Kannur now, and is live up to Kuttanand in Palakkad district, 90 km north of Kochi since June 2019 and of the remaining 354 km the line is ready up to Kannur. Kuttanad is the main junction of the project as from here the line bifurcates to Managalore and Bengaluru.\n\nThe first phase of the project was commissioned in August 2013 in the Kochi metropolitan area with industrial supplies and domestic supplies from February 2016 by Adani Gas.\n\nToday the pipeline supplies 3.8 million cubic metres of gas every day to industrial and residential customers in Kochi and is set to cross 4 million cubic metres soon in the city itself, while Mangalore has a potential of 2.5 million cubic metres per day, Murugesan said.\n\nWith the commissioning the pipeline, gas demand in the state will touch 80-90 million cubic metres per annum from 60 million cubic metres now.\n\nThe pipeline is a big boost to the struggling Kochi LNT Terminal of Petronet which has a capacity of 5 million tonne annually but 90 per cent capacity has been idling due to the delay in completing the Kochi-Mangalore pipeline and Murugesan said with the commissioning the capacity utilisation of the LNG terminal will go up to 25-30 per cent.\n\nApart from huge environmental gains, the state can also gain monetarily as it can get up to Rs 1,000 crore by way of taxes alone.

    "full_article": "India\u2019s economic transformation is kicking into high gear.Global manufacturers are looking beyond China, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepping up to seize the moment. The government is spending nearly 20% of its budget this fiscal year on capital investments, the most in at least a decade.\n\nModi is closer than any predecessor to being able to claim that the nation \u2014 which may have just passed China as the world\u2019s most populous \u2014 is finally meeting its economic potential. To get there, he\u2019ll have to wrestle with the drawbacks of its exceptional scale: the remnants of the red tape and corruption that has slowed India\u2019s rise, and the stark inequality that defines the democracy of 1.4 billion people.\n\n\u201cIndia is on the cusp of huge change,\u201d said Nandan Nilekani, a founder of Infosys Ltd., one of the nation\u2019s largest technology services companies. India has quickly created capacity to support tens of thousands of startups, a few billion smartphones and data rates that rank among the lowest in the world, he said.\n\nUS-China rivalry is providing a tailwind. India and Vietnam will be the big beneficiaries as companies move toward a \u201cChina-plus-one\u201d strategy, supply-chain analysts say. Apple Inc.\u2019s three key Taiwanese suppliers have won incentives from Modi\u2019s government to boost smartphone production and exports. Shipments more than doubled to top $2.5 billion of iPhones from April through December.\n\nAs powerhouses from China to Germany contend with slowing growth, the stakes are rising to find another nation equipped to propel the global economy. Morgan Stanley predicts that India will drive a fifth of world expansion this decade, positioning the nation as one of only three that can generate more than $400 billion in annual output growth.\n\nThe thesis is reflected in global equity markets, with India\u2019s Sensex index trading last quarter at the highest in a decade versus the S&P 500. Relative to other emerging markets, Indian stocks have never been higher.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking at which other place over the next decade is going to be a great place to put capital,\u201d Nilekani said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of interest in India for 15 years.\u201d\n\nOf course, Modi\u2019s manufacturing aspirations are not new. His \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign kicked off in 2014, seeking to emulate China and the tigers of East Asia \u2014 from Singapore to South Korea and Taiwan \u2014 that climbed into the ranks of rich economies by filling factories with workers making products the world wanted to buy.\n\nBoosting manufacturing to 25% of GDP, a key metric for the program, has proven elusive. The ratio rose to 17.4% in 2020 compared with 15.3% in 2000, according to data from McKinsey. Vietnam\u2019s factory sector more than doubled its share of GDP during the same period.\n\nBut as this year\u2019s president of the Group of 20 nations, India has momentum. An external strategy built on multiple alliances and unapologetic self-interest has seen the nation boost purchases of Russian oil by 33 times, ignoring pressure from Washington. There are even some signs of pragmatism when it comes to the tense relationship with neighboring China \u2014 more than a dozen of Apple\u2019s Chinese suppliers are receiving initial clearance from New Delhi to expand operations, underpinning the tech giant\u2019s efforts to divert production to India.\n\nIn a multipolar world, India\u2019s embrace of a middle path has bolstered its image as a nation \u201cwith which everyone is interested in having a good relationship,\u201d said Kenneth Juster, a former US ambassador to India.\n\n\u201cIndia is positioning itself, and using its presidency of the G-20 to do so, as a bridge between east and west, and north and south,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of companies feel that given its size, given its young population, given its inevitable force in international affairs, India is a place where they should be.\u201d\n\nIn an August speech commemorating 75 years since India\u2019s independence, Modi urged the nation to settle for nothing less than to \u201cdominate the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must resolve to make India a developed nation in the next 25 years,\u201d he said at the Red Fort in New Delhi, occasionally swatting the air with clenched fists. Helicopters showered the crowd with flower petals before he spoke. Bloomberg Economics expects the nation\u2019s per capita income to pull even with some developed countries in that span, putting Modi\u2019s goal within reach. Potential GDP growth will gradually peak at about 8.5% early next decade, propelled by corporate tax cuts, incentives for manufacturers and privatization of public assets, according to BE. The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts India to become a $10 trillion economy by 2035.\n\nBattling Bureaucracy\n\nTo meet his target, Modi will have to overcome the legacy of India\u2019s early years as an independent nation, which included decades of squandered economic opportunity.\n\nAfter Britain\u2019s partition of the subcontinent in 1947 and the religious violence that followed, India turned inward. By the 1970s, much of the economy was nationalized and a formidable bureaucracy shut out the world. A labyrinthine system called the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d dictated everything from car models to what types of bread were allowed in stores.\n\nIn 1991, a balance of payments crisis forced change. Facing plunging foreign exchange reserves and pressure from the International Monetary Fund, then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh endorsed devaluing the rupee and opening up to foreign investment.\n\nThe reforms were a hard sell. But by the end of the decade, changes to India\u2019s economic landscape were undeniable. GDP close to doubled. International brands from McDonald\u2019s to Microsoft offered new choices. In the 2000s, India notched several years of growth near 8%.\n\nWhen Modi rose to power in 2014, campaigning on \u201cminimum government, maximum governance,\u201d voters saw an opportunity to build on liberalization, hoping for \u201cRonald Reagan on a white horse,\u201d as a prominent economist put it.\n\nIndia\u2019s new prime minister, the son of a tea seller, promised to clear the remaining cobwebs from the License Raj, including a culture of paying bribes for access to public services. Modi styled himself as a political outsider with managerial panache, poised to apply his experience running Gujarat, one of the nation\u2019s most industrialized states, to propel India toward top-down development, \u00e0 la China.\n\nHe can claim significant progress, especially on infrastructure. Since Modi's election win in 2014, India\u2019s national highway network grew more than 50% longer, domestic air passengers roughly doubled and a vast biometric system helped several hundred million people open bank accounts for the first time.\n\nAmong Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s most heralded achievements has been forging a single economic zone from India\u2019s overlapping federal and state taxes, perhaps the most consequential measure since 1991. Tax revenue collection hit a high last year, jumping 34% from the previous year. The government will lay out its budget for the next fiscal year on Feb. 1.\n\nStreamlining India\u2019s economy has \u201cbrought a lot more transparency in the system,\u201d said Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, one of the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturers. \u201cLook at collection now. The government is getting double or triple what they were getting in the previous regime.\u201d\n\nThe reception was chillier for Modi\u2019s 2016 ban on nearly all local-currency banknotes to fight corruption and tax avoidance. The shock announcement devastated Indians working for cash daily wages. And Modi struck another speed bump when he took his liberalization campaign to the agricultural sector, which makes up about a fifth of the economy. Sweeping reforms were abandoned in 2021 after mass protests saw thousands of farmers camping on the outskirts of the capital for months.\n\nGurcharan Das, an author and former chief executive of Procter & Gamble India, said Modi still has much to prove if he wants to transform India in the way that Margaret Thatcher revolutionized Britain. Part of the challenge is that Indian voters \u2014 many of whom still live on less than a few dollars a day \u2014 gravitate to tangible political pledges like free electricity, rather than abstract policies to spur investment.\n\n\u201cIn India, nobody has sold the reforms, so people believe they\u2019ll make the rich richer and the poor poorer,\u201d Das said.\n\nBut Sanjeev Sanyal, an economic advisor to Modi\u2019s administration, projected confidence, characterizing these issues as teething troubles that would afflict any young nation.\n\nBoosting supply side productivity, enabling creative destruction and continuing to reduce absolute poverty are among India\u2019s objectives for the next 25 years, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are finally getting rid of the bureaucratic shackles in our heads,\u201d Sanyal said.\n\nRising Inequality\n\nIndia\u2019s population stood at 1.417 billion at the end of last year, according to estimates from the World Population Review, about 5 million more than China has reported. The United Nations expects India to reach the milestone later this year. Half of India\u2019s people are under the age of 30, while China\u2019s citizens are aging rapidly, and its population shrank in 2022 for the first time since the final year of the Great Famine in the 1960s.\n\nAmong other notable differences: India\u2019s middle class remains significantly smaller. Fully capturing the nation\u2019s demographic dividend \u2014 perhaps its biggest advantage compared to bigger economies \u2014 will require broader wealth creation that resolves high unemployment among women, minorities and young people.\n\n\u201cIf we do not take care of inequality, we can\u2019t get very far with growth,\u201d said Duvvuri Subbarao, a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nNowhere else is the super wealthy growing faster than in India, drawing comparisons to the heady times of America\u2019s Gilded Age. Since 1995, the wealth gap between the top 1% and bottom 50% has soared about three times more than the equivalent metric for the US.\n\nA new class of entrepreneurs is creating more unicorns \u2014 unlisted companies worth at least $1 billion \u2014 than any other nation apart from the US and China. Their growing success is propelling property prices in Mumbai and Bangalore hotspots, while encouraging firms from UBS Group AG to Deutsche Bank AG to hire more private bankers.Yet by one estimate, female labor force participation fell to 9% by 2022, in part because of the pandemic. Closing the gap between men and women \u2014 58 percentage points \u2014 could expand India\u2019s GDP by more than 30% by 2050, an analysis from Bloomberg Economics found.\n\nIndia\u2019s large Muslim minority is also underrepresented. Despite forming 14% of the population, they\u2019re estimated to hold about 7% of public sector jobs. Government critics fear that India\u2019s secular foundation, and the economic potential of some 300 million people among its religious minorities, are being undermined by hardline officials who\u2019ve pushed for India to formally recast itself as a Hindu nation. Modi worked for years in a Hindu-right organization before running for public office.\n\n\u201cA whole section of our people live more and more in a kind of continuous insecurity,\u201d said Harsh Mander, a social activist and founder of the Centre for Equity Studies, a research organization in New Delhi. This dynamic, he said, \u201cwill be stifling for secure investment.\u201d\n\nFactory Dreams\n\nSanyal, the economic advisor to Modi\u2019s administration, said the government is working to create opportunities for all Indians and it\u2019s unfair to hold one leader responsible for long-running challenges. Raising manufacturing to a quarter of GDP \u2014 and the jobs bounty that would come along with it \u2014 remains a top priority. While India\u2019s contribution to global trade is less than 2%, merchandise exports exceeded a record $400 billion last fiscal year.\n\nTo compete with China, the government is providing more than $24 billion in incentives over the next few years in more than a dozen industries. Some of the money will support the production of mobile phone handsets by Wistron Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.; semi-conductors by Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.; and solar panels by Reliance Industries Ltd. In coming months the program will be extended to manufacturers of electrolyzers and other equipment needed to make green hydrogen.\n\nThe next step is boosting production beyond the world\u2019s manufacturing behemoths.\n\nShiv Bhargava, the founder of Viraj Exports, a mid-sized garment exporter, said building scale in India can be difficult. At his factory in the industrial city of Noida, Bhargava weaved between sewing stations where workers stitched clothing bound for Zara. He has about 1,000 staff in the country, but says he\u2019d have more if it weren\u2019t for relatively restrictive labor laws. Modi has sought to streamline the rules, sparking fierce opposition from some state governments.\n\n\u201cCompared to Bangladesh, our costs are 40% to 50% higher,\u201d Bhargava said. \u201cWhen the economy of a country goes up, then labor has the option to have better options.\u201d\n\nSome younger Indians, aspiring to white collar work, are deferring employment rather than laboring in a factory. About half of potential workers under the age of 30 aren\u2019t even looking for jobs.\n\nThe numbers are also explained by changing employment patterns, especially in rural areas, home to much of India\u2019s population. In Haryana, a key farming state, the evaporation of agricultural jobs has forced workers to migrate from towns to urban centers.\n\nPerched on a rope cot, Kusum, a young woman who lost a teaching position during the pandemic, said liberalization has benefited the village of Mundakhera. Her family can now afford a washing machine and motorcycle. Every morning, she uses her smartphone to scan Google for employment opportunities and catch up on current events.\n\nBut as farming declines, she said, India has to move faster to equip her generation with marketable skills in a more globalized economy. Quality jobs are now scarcer in Mundakhera, where tidy brick homes surround a pond speckled with algae.\n\n\u201cOur education is not skill-based and the private sector needs that,\u201d she said.\n\nBuilding India\u2019s Future\n\nEven with those obstacles, optimism pervades India\u2019s business elite. Entrepreneurs are eager to capitalize on a stronger tolerance for risk-taking, higher consumer spending and a vibrant ecosystem for digital startups.\n\nIn Mumbai, the airy headquarters of Nykaa is abuzz as young employees film content with makeup kits. The business, India\u2019s top e-commerce site for beauty products, has a fervent following among Bollywood stars and more than 100 brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nFalguni Nayar, a former banker who started Nykaa with her daughter in 2012, said India has cleared \u201cbanana skins\u201d that entrepreneurs used to slip on. The industry benefitted from changes like the easing of taxes on premium products, she said. In 2021, Nykaa raised 53.5 billion rupees (about $660 million) in a stellar initial public offering, helping to make Nayar the country\u2019s richest self-made woman.\n\n\u201cBefore we know it, we\u2019ll be the third largest economy in the world,\u201d she said. Nayar\u2019s often asked if consumption is stronger in cities than in rural areas. \u201cNot anymore,\u201d she said. In many towns, \u201cif earlier we used to see fans, now they\u2019ll have air conditioners and refrigerators.\u201d\n\nModi\u2019s popularity remains robust, giving him a platform to enact change that many world leaders would envy. Polls consistently peg the prime minister\u2019s approval rating above 70%.This month Modi urged members of his ruling party to reach out to Muslims and other religious minorities, a rare move to tone down sectarian tensions as he prepares to host the G-20 summit. With national elections due in 2024, the question on the horizon is the extent to which economic ambition will shape Modi\u2019s agenda and how he expends his political capital.",
    "cleaned_article": "India\u2019s economic transformation is kicking into high gear.Global manufacturers are looking beyond China, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepping up to seize the moment. The government is spending nearly 20% of its budget this fiscal year on capital investments, the most in at least a decade. Modi is closer than any predecessor to being able to claim that the nation \u2014 which may have just passed China as the world\u2019s most populous \u2014 is finally meeting its economic potential. To get there, he\u2019ll have to wrestle with the drawbacks of its exceptional scale: the remnants of the red tape and corruption that has slowed India\u2019s rise, and the stark inequality that defines the democracy of 1.4 billion people. \u201cIndia is on the cusp of huge change,\u201d said Nandan Nilekani, a founder of Infosys Ltd., one of the nation\u2019s largest technology services companies. India has quickly created capacity to support tens of thousands of startups, a few billion smartphones and data rates that rank among the lowest in the world, he said. US-China rivalry is providing a tailwind. India and Vietnam will be the big beneficiaries as companies move toward a \u201cChina-plus-one\u201d strategy, supply-chain analysts say. Apple Inc.\u2019s three key Taiwanese suppliers have won incentives from Modi\u2019s government to boost smartphone production and exports. Shipments more than doubled to top $2.5 billion of iPhones from April through December. As powerhouses from China to Germany contend with slowing growth, the stakes are rising to find another nation equipped to propel the global economy. Morgan Stanley predicts that India will drive a fifth of world expansion this decade, positioning the nation as one of only three that can generate more than $400 billion in annual output growth. The thesis is reflected in global equity markets, with India\u2019s Sensex index trading last quarter at the highest in a decade versus the S&P 500. Relative to other emerging markets, Indian stocks have never been higher. \u201cPeople are looking at which other place over the next decade is going to be a great place to put capital,\u201d Nilekani said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this kind of interest in India for 15 years.\u201d Of course, Modi\u2019s manufacturing aspirations are not new. His \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign kicked off in 2014, seeking to emulate China and the tigers of East Asia \u2014 from Singapore to South Korea and Taiwan \u2014 that climbed into the ranks of rich economies by filling factories with workers making products the world wanted to buy. Boosting manufacturing to 25% of GDP, a key metric for the program, has proven elusive. The ratio rose to 17.4% in 2020 compared with 15.3% in 2000, according to data from McKinsey. Vietnam\u2019s factory sector more than doubled its share of GDP during the same period. But as this year\u2019s president of the Group of 20 nations, India has momentum. An external strategy built on multiple alliances and unapologetic self-interest has seen the nation boost purchases of Russian oil by 33 times, ignoring pressure from Washington. There are even some signs of pragmatism when it comes to the tense relationship with neighboring China \u2014 more than a dozen of Apple\u2019s Chinese suppliers are receiving initial clearance from New Delhi to expand operations, underpinning the tech giant\u2019s efforts to divert production to India. In a multipolar world, India\u2019s embrace of a middle path has bolstered its image as a nation \u201cwith which everyone is interested in having a good relationship,\u201d said Kenneth Juster, a former US ambassador to India. \u201cIndia is positioning itself, and using its presidency of the G-20 to do so, as a bridge between east and west, and north and south,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of companies feel that given its size, given its young population, given its inevitable force in international affairs, India is a place where they should be.\u201d In an August speech commemorating 75 years since India\u2019s independence, Modi urged the nation to settle for nothing less than to \u201cdominate the world.\u201d \u201cWe must resolve to make India a developed nation in the next 25 years,\u201d he said at the Red Fort in New Delhi, occasionally swatting the air with clenched fists. Helicopters showered the crowd with flower petals before he spoke. Bloomberg Economics expects the nation\u2019s per capita income to pull even with some developed countries in that span, putting Modi\u2019s goal within reach. Potential GDP growth will gradually peak at about 8.5% early next decade, propelled by corporate tax cuts, incentives for manufacturers and privatization of public assets, according to BE. The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts India to become a $10 trillion economy by 2035. Battling Bureaucracy To meet his target, Modi will have to overcome the legacy of India\u2019s early years as an independent nation, which included decades of squandered economic opportunity. After Britain\u2019s partition of the subcontinent in 1947 and the religious violence that followed, India turned inward. By the 1970s, much of the economy was nationalized and a formidable bureaucracy shut out the world. A labyrinthine system called the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d dictated everything from car models to what types of bread were allowed in stores. In 1991, a balance of payments crisis forced change. Facing plunging foreign exchange reserves and pressure from the International Monetary Fund, then-Finance Minister Manmohan Singh endorsed devaluing the rupee and opening up to foreign investment.

While there are positive indicators such as rising tax revenues and economic growth projections, the emphasis on aggressive spending and incentives for industrial expansion implies a potential rise in the fiscal deficit. The article does not provide clear evidence of measures to offset this spending, such as significant tax reforms or austerity measures. Therefore, the future fiscal deficit is likely to increase, warranting a negative score.\n\n**",

    "full_article": "Live Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket has rallied by 25% from the lows it had witnessed in the month of June. This was mainly due to no major downgrade to corporate earnings and inexpensive valuation based on expected FY24 earnings.However, the Nifty50 is now currently trading at 20x FY24 and we do not see any valuation expansion in a higher interest rate regime.So, broadly the upside will be in line with earnings growth of 12-15% over the next 1 year.Markets are great at anticipating levels of economic growth and corporate earnings momentum and therefore, stock prices react well in advance.We are one of few large economies showing resilience amidst a global slowdown, and our markets have accordingly paced ahead.Responding to an increase in global interest rates and a diminishing risk environment, FIIs sold ~ US$ 55bn of Indian equities over the last 2 years.As confidence in the Indian growth story solidifies \u2013 we believe, FII allocation to Indian equities will again turn positive \u2013 early signs are visible and encouraging.Until last year, exports comprising merchandising trade and services (IT services, software) allowed the economy to rebound.And now, there\u2019s a beautiful transition to the domestic economy. This is a truly unique phenomenon globally and makes India stand out.India\u2019s famed consumption economy has held steady and continued to power our growth. A welcome surprise was our agriculture sector which grew above historical trends.We are facing genuine headwinds in exports due to a global slowdown. For now, this is well compensated by the domestic economy.Another factor to consider is the nominal growth of our economy (real growth + inflation).

This was mainly due to no major downgrade to corporate earnings and inexpensive valuation based on expected FY24 earnings.However, the Nifty50 is now currently trading at 20x FY24 and we do not see any valuation expansion in a higher interest rate regime.So, broadly the upside will be in line with earnings growth of 12-15% over the next 1 year.Markets are great at anticipating levels of economic growth and corporate earnings momentum and therefore, stock prices react well in advance.We are one of few large economies showing resilience amidst a global slowdown, and our markets have accordingly paced ahead.Responding to an increase in global interest rates and a diminishing risk environment, FIIs sold ~ US$ 55bn of Indian equities over the last 2 years.As confidence in the Indian growth story solidifies \u2013 we believe, FII allocation to Indian equities will again turn positive \u2013 early signs are visible and encouraging.Until last year, exports comprising merchandising trade and services (IT services, software) allowed the economy to rebound.And now, there\u2019s a beautiful transition to the domestic economy. This is a truly unique phenomenon globally and makes India stand out.India\u2019s famed consumption economy has held steady and continued to power our growth. A welcome surprise was our agriculture sector which grew above historical trends.We are facing genuine headwinds in exports due to a global slowdown. For now, this is well compensated by the domestic economy.Another factor to consider is the nominal growth of our economy (real growth + inflation). This powers consumer incomes (wage growth) as well as corporate profits in sectors that directly benefit (consumption, banking and financial services).

However, it does mention that government tax collections (both direct taxes and GST) are at an all-time high, which could positively impact future fiscal deficits by increasing revenue. Additionally, the article highlights the government\u2019s continued drive to invest in infrastructure and the \"Make in India\" initiative, which suggests sustained or potentially increased government spending. While higher tax revenues could help reduce the deficit, the emphasis on infrastructure spending and other government initiatives implies that expenditures may remain elevated or even rise. There is no clear indication of fiscal consolidation or significant deficit reduction efforts. Given the lack of explicit fiscal deficit predictions but the implication of continued or increased spending, the future fiscal deficit direction leans slightly negative.  \n\n**",

Most of the states that have refused to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, even though the federal government would bear the great bulk of the cost, are former slave states.\"\n\nAnd then, he adds, \"The Italian-American economist Alberto Alesina suddenly died on March 23; among his best work was a joint paper that examined the reasons America doesn't have a European-style welfare state.

It is there for all, including India, to see and learn from.\n\nThe European model versus the US one\n\nThe work Krugman refers to was published in 2001 by Harvard University, 'Why Doesn't the US Have a European-Style Welfare State'. The concluding paragraph of it puts the findings very succinctly and is reproduced below.\n\nIt had found many more outcomes which are relevant. It said \"post-tax income inequality is lower in countries with large governments and in particular, with large social spending\", adding that \"it is pretty clear that income inequality is lower in Nordic countries, intermediate in central and southern Europe, higher in the UK and even higher in the US\".\n\nThe situation remains unchanged since then.\n\nA 2019 OECD study shows that the average social spending of its members (37 countries, including the US and European countries) was above 20% of GDP in 2018. Many European countries like France (more than 30%), Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Germany, Norway and even the UK (just above 20%) spent more than the average, while the US spent less.\n\nIndia's social sector spending is awfully low in comparison. India has been spending (Centre and states combined) less than 8%. The health sector spending has remained at 2.8-3.2% since FY12.\n\nThe size of government is measured as general government expenditure relative to the size of economy of a country (GDP).\n\nThe OECD database shows the average size of government in 2018 in 28 member countries (for which data is available), was 43%. Many European governments were spending more than 50% of their respective GDPs (like France, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark). The US was, again, in the bottom pile with 38%.\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XIX: Where is excess liquidity generated by RBI going?\n\nThe US is considered a 'small government'. India is even smaller in comparison.\n\nIn 2018, India's general government expenditure (Centre and states combined) was just 18.2% of its GDP. Since FY12, the number has been confined to a narrow band of 17.2-18.4%.\n\nThe impact of low social sector spending and small government is evident in India now. The plight of the migrants, fleeing in millions back to their villages for weeks, some of them walking hundreds of miles with kids and elderly, is one.\n\nThe second is gross inadequacies of its healthcare system exposed by the virus and the third is its inability to provide a big fiscal stimulus (fiscal spending announced in its relief packages amount to just 1% of its GDP) which is needed to kick-start the locked down economy.\n\nOne caveat is in order. Economists attribute the low government spending in India (small government) to its relatively lower tax revenue. India's tax-to-GDP ratio is less than 20% (Centre and states combined).\n\nIn FY19, it was 18.5%. For the OECD countries (which comes closest to India's FY19), the average was 34.3% in 2018 (of 34 countries for which data is available). Here too, the US lagged behind with 24.3%.\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XVIII: Why India urgently needs SOPs for decision-making\n\nSmall government is not beautiful\n\nA few days earlier, when the US was about to record 100,000 deaths, another Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz had spoken about the US's broken healthcare and other shortcomings in handling the crisis.\n\nIn an interview (on May 26), he said, \"I think Americans have become aware as a result of the pandemic that there are some aspects of our economy and our society that aren't functioning well, that we don't have a functioning healthcare system, that the pandemic has gone after people in poor health and we have so many more of those people in the US than you'd expect in a rich country.\"\n\nHe pinned the ills on 40 years of economic thinking that denigrated the role of government (advocating small government) while allowing unrestrained market forces to prevail. This is not restricted to the US alone but has spread to other countries too.\n\nHe suggested a course correction, reminding that while it is the duty of governments to handle the crisis; the market isn't geared for it.\n\nIt is fairly known that a strong push for small government came in 1980s when multilateral US-based agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) played a key role (read Coronavirus Lockdown XVII: The economics behind India's Rs 21 lakh crore package).\n\nIn this economics, there is little room for the European-style welfare state which spends more on social security (redistributes more) and has big governments. But the IMF has begun to see merit in it.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, it published a paper in December 2018, 'Shifting Tides: Dramatic social changes mean the welfare state is more necessary than ever'. It found the welfare state as a means to absorb the risks that market failure can produce.\n\nIn all, it cited three reasons for this shift in thinking, as reproduced below.\n\nTalking about healthcare risks, it says the US is \"unique among advanced economies\" to rely on private actuarial insurance to address its health risks while \"it is almost universally accepted among advanced economies that intractable market failures make private actuarial insurance a bad fit for medical risks...\"\n\nAlso read: Coronavirus Lockdown XVI: Why India should be wary of excessive push for liquidity or credit\n\nHealth economist Dr. Indranil Mukhopadhyay of OP Jindal University explains what private actuarial insurance is and why it is prone to market failures.\n\nAbout the insurance model, he says, \"The private voluntary insurance that we buy for us and our families works on calculation of risks, a method called actuarial science. To put it simply, it estimates the financial risks of say, hospitalisation, for the population. The actuarial premium to be paid is the average cost of care adjusted for diverse risks of falling ill. In practice, however, management and administrative costs and profits are added ('overload'), increasing the premium.\"\n\nAbout the associated market failures, he states, \"There are well-known market failures of such voluntary health insurance. First, in order to make profit, such schemes work on exclusion and claim rejection. They tend to include healthy and young people and exclude the needy ('cream-skimming'). They reject a lot of claims and expect patients to bear a part of the cost; people are thus denied care or end up paying huge bills.\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XV: Not just stimulus 2.0, getting fiscal mathematics right is critical too\n\n\"This is very common in the US and in India. The main purpose of risk pooling, financial protection, and free care thus gets defeated. Moreover, it creates monopolies in the hospital market; big hospital chains eat up the small ones, and cost of care increases further.\"\n\nA US-based doctor explains the consequences for the US in simpler words: Health costs are very high even for the young and many, like the unemployed and poor don't have health insurance cover and are deprived of healthcare.\n\nNewspapers have been highlighting the plight of US citizens fighting the pandemic. One particular article in The Guardian sums it all up well in the headline, \"Profit over people, cost over care: America's broken healthcare exposed by virus\".\n\nIndia needs to be on guard against following the same path.\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XIV: India needs to own and indulge its workers; they are more vulnerable than ever\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XIII: Five steps to rebuild a post-COVID economy\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XII: Why the wealthy should be taxed more\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XI: Why India's health policy needs a course correction\n\nAlso Read: Coronavirus Lockdown X: Why it can't be business as usual for India",

He suggested a course correction, reminding that while it is the duty of governments to handle the crisis; the market isn't geared for it. It is fairly known that a strong push for small government came in 1980s when multilateral US-based agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) played a key role (read Coronavirus Lockdown XVII: The economics behind India's Rs 21 lakh crore package). In this economics, there is little room for the European-style welfare state which spends more on social security (redistributes more) and has big governments. But the IMF has begun to see merit in it. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, it published a paper in December 2018, 'Shifting Tides: Dramatic social changes mean the welfare state is more necessary than ever'. It found the welfare state as a means to absorb the risks that market failure can produce. In all, it cited three reasons for this shift in thinking, as reproduced below. Talking about healthcare risks, it says the US is \"unique among advanced economies\" to rely on private actuarial insurance to address its health risks while \"it is almost universally accepted among advanced economies that intractable market failures make private actuarial insurance a bad fit for medical risks...\" Also read: Coronavirus Lockdown XVI: Why India should be wary of excessive push for liquidity or credit Health economist Dr. Indranil Mukhopadhyay of OP Jindal University explains what private actuarial insurance is and why it is prone to market failures. About the insurance model, he says, \"The private voluntary insurance that we buy for us and our families works on calculation of risks, a method called actuarial science. To put it simply, it estimates the financial risks of say, hospitalisation, for the population. The actuarial premium to be paid is the average cost of care adjusted for diverse risks of falling ill. In practice, however, management and administrative costs and profits are added ('overload'), increasing the premium.\" About the associated market failures, he states, \"There are well-known market failures of such voluntary health insurance. First, in order to make profit, such schemes work on exclusion and claim rejection. They tend to include healthy and young people and exclude the needy ('cream-skimming'). They reject a lot of claims and expect patients to bear a part of the cost; people are thus denied care or end up paying huge bills. Also Read: Coronavirus Lockdown XV: Not just stimulus 2.0, getting fiscal mathematics right is critical too \"This is very common in the US and in India. The main purpose of risk pooling, financial protection, and free care thus gets defeated. Moreover, it creates monopolies in the hospital market; big hospital chains eat up the small ones, and cost of care increases further.\" A US-based doctor explains the consequences for the US in simpler words: Health costs are very high even for the young and many, like the unemployed and poor don't have health insurance cover and are deprived of healthcare. Newspapers have been highlighting the plight of US citizens fighting the pandemic. One particular article in The Guardian sums it all up well in the headline, \"Profit over people, cost over care: America's broken healthcare exposed by virus\". India needs to be on guard against following the same path.

It highlights the lack of universal healthcare and low social spending in the US compared to European countries. While the article critiques the current state of fiscal policy and social spending, it does not provide explicit predictions or plans regarding future government spending, tax revenues, or fiscal policy changes that would directly impact the future fiscal deficit. The discussion about the need for a European-style welfare state and increased social spending could imply potential future increases in government expenditure, but this is not explicitly stated or quantified. Therefore, there is no clear indication of the future direction of the fiscal deficit.",

This increase is attributed to the government's Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, which includes higher expenditures and lower revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The article also mentions additional borrowing of Rs 4.2 lakh crore (2.1% of GDP) and raises concerns about the sustainability of government debt, which has been rising since FY11. While the article does not explicitly predict the fiscal deficit beyond FY21, the combination of increased spending, revenue shortfalls, and higher borrowing suggests a negative trajectory for the fiscal deficit in the near future. The discussion on sustainable debt limits further implies that fiscal pressures may persist, potentially leading to continued deficits.  \n\n**",

There are no signs, despite low inflation, of an effort to restore a role for fiscal policy, which could make a difference.\n\nAnd, the fourth is that uncertainties generated by the rise of unpredictable right-wing regimes and by the never-ending Brexit prospect have possibly had some dampening effect on investment and growth.\n\nThe despondency this has generated is also tinged with an element of alarm, because of signs of an inversion of the yield curve. While it is normal under capitalism for longer term interest rates to rule higher than short-term rates, in late March, the interest rate on a three-month Treasury bill was, at 2.43 per cent, 0.05 percentage points higher than the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury bond of 2.38 per cent.\n\nIn the past, an inverted yield curve pointing to little interest in accessing long-term capital was a signal of a possible recession. Combined with the evidence on slowing growth that prospect is being referred to by many observers as a signal that another downturn is likely.\n\nLanguishing Euro Zone\n\nFor the world economy, these developments on the US front are especially troubling, because the US was expected to pull the rest out of a recessionary quagmire. Economies in the Euro Zone are languishing with annualised quarterly growth rates in the 19 Euro area countries falling consistently since the third quarter of 2017 (Chart 3).\n\nFrom a high of 2.8 per cent in that quarter, growth is down to just 1.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2018. The long-term buoyancy displayed by Germany has given way to projections that the country\u2019s growth in 2019 would be lower than 1 per cent as compared with earlier expectations of nearly 2 per cent.\n\nAs compared with a peak rate of 2.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017, Germany\u2019s GDP rose by just 0.6 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2018. Elsewhere, the two fast growing emerging markets, China and India are also showing signs of losing momentum (Chart 4). After having been stuck with year-on-year growth rates of 6.7-6.8 per cent for seven quarters ending Q2 2018, GDP growth in China has moved further down to 6.4 per cent by Q4 2018.\n\nIndia\u2019s quarterly rates have been volatile, but have come down from 7.9 per cent to 6.8 per cent in the three quarters ending Q4 2018. These were the economies that were seen as decoupled from the rest of the world system at the time of the 2008 crisis, and capable of lifting the rest out of recession. They too seem to be slipping now.\n\nTo any sensible observer, 10 years of waiting for a robust recovery should have driven home one lesson. Since everything tried so far has not worked, the only option left is a strong countercyclical thrust delivered by restoring a leading role for fiscal policy.\n\nFinance power\n\nBut there are two among many other factors constraining the exercise of that option. The first is the power of finance, restored after the financial crisis through state action in the form of fiscal support to prevent insolvency and monetary support with cheap and bountiful credit to help financial firms ride back to profit. But having won back strength and power finance stands as a bulwark against any effort to use fiscal policy that would legitimise the state and delegitimise the market.\n\nThe second is that in a globalised world with absent capital controls and hence volatile cross-border financial flows, no one nation can choose to adopt a proactive fiscal policy by itself. Since government deficits are anathema for finance, that could trigger capital outflows and a precipitous depreciation of the currency.\n\nWhat is needed is a coordinated fiscal stimulus. Unfortunately, the cooperative spirit among nations needed for action of that kind is absent, and was seen in recent times only briefly during the worst phase of the 2008 crisis and the Great Recession that followed.\n\nIn sum, the world is poised in a peculiar situation. Slow growth can possibly give way to recession. Monetary policy has been pushed to its limits without much success. And even the little effect it had in recent times cannot be realised if there is another recession, since there is little monetary headroom available.\n\nYet the mainstream consensus is that proactive fiscal policies, whose role circumstances demand must be restored, must be abjured. One crisis has not been enough for the system to restructure itself, so that another is now a real possibility.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit",

After having been stuck with year-on-year growth rates of 6.7-6.8 per cent for seven quarters ending Q2 2018, GDP growth in China has moved further down to 6.4 per cent by Q4 2018. India\u2019s quarterly rates have been volatile, but have come down from 7.9 per cent to 6.8 per cent in the three quarters ending Q4 2018. These were the economies that were seen as decoupled from the rest of the world system at the time of the 2008 crisis, and capable of lifting the rest out of recession. They too seem to be slipping now. To any sensible observer, 10 years of waiting for a robust recovery should have driven home one lesson. Since everything tried so far has not worked, the only option left is a strong countercyclical thrust delivered by restoring a leading role for fiscal policy. Finance power But there are two among many other factors constraining the exercise of that option. The first is the power of finance, restored after the financial crisis through state action in the form of fiscal support to prevent insolvency and monetary support with cheap and bountiful credit to help financial firms ride back to profit. But having won back strength and power finance stands as a bulwark against any effort to use fiscal policy that would legitimise the state and delegitimise the market. The second is that in a globalised world with absent capital controls and hence volatile cross-border financial flows, no one nation can choose to adopt a proactive fiscal policy by itself. Since government deficits are anathema for finance, that could trigger capital outflows and a precipitous depreciation of the currency. What is needed is a coordinated fiscal stimulus. Unfortunately, the cooperative spirit among nations needed for action of that kind is absent, and was seen in recent times only briefly during the worst phase of the 2008 crisis and the Great Recession that followed. In sum, the world is poised in a peculiar situation. Slow growth can possibly give way to recession. Monetary policy has been pushed to its limits without much success. And even the little effect it had in recent times cannot be realised if there is another recession, since there is little monetary headroom available. Yet the mainstream consensus is that proactive fiscal policies, whose role circumstances demand must be restored, must be abjured. One crisis has not been enough for the system to restructure itself, so that another is now a real possibility. SHARE Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: **ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article highlights several factors that suggest a potential increase in future fiscal deficits. First, it notes that the US economic growth is losing momentum, which could lead to reduced tax revenues. Second, the Federal Reserve's decision to halt interest rate hikes indicates a cautious approach to economic conditions, which might necessitate increased government spending to stimulate growth. Third, the article emphasizes the lack of proactive fiscal policy initiatives despite low inflation, suggesting that governments may resort to deficit spending to address economic stagnation. Additionally, the global economic slowdown, particularly in the Euro Zone and emerging markets like China and India, could further pressure governments to increase spending to counteract recessionary trends. The article also mentions the constraints on fiscal policy due to the power of finance and the lack of coordinated fiscal stimulus among nations, which could exacerbate deficits if individual countries act unilaterally. Overall, the article implies that future fiscal deficits are likely to increase due to economic slowdown, potential recessionary pressures, and the absence of effective fiscal",

The committee is already in talks with the National Medical Commission and other specific boards for this new initiative, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are working at being able to offer education (courses in medicine/nursing/pharmacy, etc.) in regional languages across India. The central idea being that in 10 years time, all the students will have the option, infrastructural and staff support to study these subjects in their mother tongue. This is not to say that English will be done away with. That option will also be kept available,\u201d he said.\n\nThe confirmation comes days after Madhya Pradesh released textbooks in Hindi for three subjects in the MBBS course as part of a project to impart medical education in Hindi.\n\nAccording to data from the Health Ministry, India has 612 medical colleges (321 government colleges and 291 private colleges) offering 91,927 undergraduate MBBS seats and 46,118 postgraduate seats. According to the Indian Nursing Council\u2019s 2021 annual report, the country has 5,162 nursing institutes.\n\nDoctors\u2019 associations have warned that doing away with language uniformity will be a regressive move that will have a negative impact on medical education and the opportunities it offers. They maintain that medical education needs to be at par with international guidelines and bodies, and a multiple language system will confuse students and lead to a fall in the quality of education.\n\nRefuting this, Mr. Shastry said, \u201cCountries, including Japan and Germany, follow the same principle and offer medical education in their respective languages. Even international students seem to be able to cope well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, we understand that 90% of the doctors, nurses and pharma professionals that we educate stay on in the country and States to work there. In this scenario, knowing the regional language is an added benefit.

Lalit reasoned that the bid offered by the Adani Enterprises Limited for every domestic passenger was \u20b9168, that is, 20% above the \u20b9135 offer given by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation.\n\nThe court also noted that the private entity had already taken over \u201coperation, management and development\u201d of the airport from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) since October 2021.\n\nThe Bench noted that the employees were given the choice to either stay with the AAI or switch over to service of the private entity. On Kerala\u2019s request, the court kept open the issue of State ownership of the airport land.\n\nThe State had alleged that preference given by the Centre to a private concessionaire like Adani, which has no experience in the field of managing airports, smacks of arbitrariness.\n\n\u201cRunning an airport is not like running any other entity. It requires a tremendous amount of experience, expertise and knowledge gained through experience,\u201d Chief Justice Lalit orally remarked during the hearing.\n\nIt asked the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General K.M. Natraj, whether it was not prudent to have made experience as one of the parameters. The government said the policy and conditions were fine tuned after several consultations.\n\nIn its appeal, the State, represented by senior advocate C.U. Singh and C.K. Sasi, argued that the Kerala High Court had favoured the handover of the vital facility to a private entity though such a move was not in the interest of better management of the airport. The entire proceeding, including the tender process, was in violation of the provisions of the Airport Authority of India Act, 1994, the State had said.\n\nThe concession was given to the Adani group despite a proposal from the Kerala government to form a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to run the airport on a revenue-sharing basis, the appeal had said.\n\nMr. Singh argued that the State had experience in running airports through its various organisations. \u201cThe Kochi International Airport at Nedumbassery, Ernakulam, which is being operated by Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), a State government- sponsored company, is one of the leading airports world over,\u201d the appeal said.\n\nThe State also referred to the Kannur International Airport. \u201cThis airport has the most modern and state-of-the-art aviation and other passenger and cargo facilities and is being operated by the Kannur International Airport Limited (KIAL), another State -government-sponsored company. It has become operational and is making progress,\u201d the appeal said.\n\nMamata bats for Sourav Ganguly, asks PM Modi to allow him contest ICC polls\n\nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on October 17, 2022, came out in support of former cricket captain Sourav Ganguly and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Ganguly should be allowed to contest elections to the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n\n\u201cI will request the Prime Minister to allow Sourav to contest ICC elections. Why is he being deprived? What is his fault?\u201d Ms. Banerjee told media persons before taking a flight to north Bengal.\n\nThe Chief Minister also raised the issue of why Ganguly was denied second term as BCCI president. The Trinamool Congress chairperson asked why \u201cAmit Babu\u2019s (Amit Shah\u2019s) son has been retained (in the BCCI)\u201d but Sourav has been left out.\n\n\u201cWhy was Sourav left out of the BCCI? The manner in which he has been removed is unjustified. I am really shocked,\u201d she said. Ms. Banerjee said that since Sourav has been removed in an unceremonious manner the only compensation that could be is to allow him to contest the ICC elections. She said that in the past Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sharad Pawar had served as ICC president and Sourav Ganguly was the most deserving to hold the post from India.\n\nThe Chief Minister, while maintaining that Sourav Ganguly was not a political person but pride of Bengal, urged the Centre not to take any decision \u201cpolitically or vindictively\u201d but to take decision for the interest of cricket.\n\nThe remarks by Ms. Banerjee come at a time when Ganguly is being replaced by Roger Binny, former cricketer and the president of Karnataka State Cricket Association as BCCI president on October 18.\n\nLast week a section of leaders from the Trinamool Congress including the party\u2019s Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen had described the decision of not giving another term to Sourav Ganguly as BCCI president as an instance of \u201cpolitical vendetta\u201d and raised questions about whether the decision had anything to do with the sports icon not joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Ganguly had also said that one cannot remain a cricket administrator forever and he had been in administration for eight years. There are also reports that Ganguly can contest elections for the post of president of Cricket Association of Bengal, a post he had held in the past.\n\nU.K. Chancellor of Exchequer Jeremy Hunt scraps nearly all government tax cut plans\n\nU.K. Chancellor of Exchequer Jeremy Hunt on October 17, 2022, reversed most of an economic package announced by the government just weeks ago, including a planned cut to income tax.\n\nIn a bid to soothe turbulent financial markets, Mr. Hunt said he was scrapping \u201calmost all\u201d the tax cuts announced last month and signaled public spending cuts are on the way.\n\nMr. Hunt said a planned 1 percentage point cut to the basic rate of income tax that had been due to take effect next year won\u2019t happen. He also scaled back a cap on energy prices designed to help households pay their bills. It will now be reviewed in April rather than lasting two years.\n\nMr. Hunt was appointed Friday after Prime Minister Liz Truss fired Kwasi Kwarteng, who spent less than six weeks in the Treasury job. Ms. Truss and Mr. Kwarteng jointly came up with a September 23 announcement of 45 billion pounds ($50 billion) in unfunded tax cuts that spooked financial markets, sent the pound to record lows and forced the Bank of England to take emergency action.\n\nMonday\u2019s hastily scheduled announcement came two weeks before Mr. Hunt is due to set out a medium-term fiscal plan.\n\nBritain Prime Minister Liz Truss drafted Mr. Hunt in on Friday after she fired his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng. Plans by Ms. Truss and Mr. Kwarteng for 45 billion pounds ($50 billion) in tax cuts \u2014 including an income tax reduction for the highest earners \u2014 without an accompanying assessment of how the government would pay for them sent the pound plunging to a record low against the U.S. dollar and the cost of government borrowing soaring.\n\nThe Bank of England was forced to step in to buy government bonds to prevent the financial crisis from spreading to the wider economy.\n\nThe government has since ditched parts of its tax-cutting plan and announced it would make a medium-term fiscal statement on October 31. But the market remained jittery, and Mr. Hunt has decided he must make a statement to calm the waters even sooner.\n\nThe Treasury said he would make a public statement, followed by a statement to the House of Commons, on Monday afternoon. Mr. Hunt spent the weekend in crisis talks with Ms. Truss, and also met Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and the head of the government\u2019s Debt Management Office.\n\nMr. Hunt\u2019s moves are aimed at restoring the government\u2019s credibility for sound fiscal policy after Ms. Truss and Mr. Kwarteng rushed out a plan for tax cuts without detailing how they would pay for them.\n\nThe unfunded tax cuts fueled investor concern about unsustainable levels of government borrowing, which pushed up government borrowing costs, raised home mortgage costs, and sent the pound plummeting to an all-time low against the dollar. The Bank of England was forced to intervene to protect pension funds squeezed by volatility in the bond market.\n\nIn Brief:\n\nJustice D.Y. Chandrachud was appointed the 50th Chief Justice of India (CJI) on October 17 after President Droupadi Murmu signed his warrant of appointment. Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju announced Justice Chandrachud\u2019s appointment in a tweet and extended his \u201cbest wishes\u201d for the formal oath-taking ceremony. Justice Chandrachud will assume charge on November 9, 2022, a day after the incumbent Justice U.U. Lalit demits office as the CJI, and will have a tenure of about two years as Chief Justice until his retirement on November 11, 2024. Justice Lalit had a brief tenure after holding the charge as the CJI for a little under three months. Justice Chandrachud would be the first second-generation Chief Justice of India. His father, Justice Y.V. Chandrachud, was the 16th Chief Justice of India and one of the longest serving ones.\n\nEvening Wrap will return tomorrow.",

On an overall basis, the energy price increase will have an inflationary effect,\u201d said Zarir Langrana, Executive Director and President (Global Chemicals Business), Tata Chemicals Limited.\n\nIn August this year, India imported 17.4 million tonnes of crude oil, valued at $9.1 billion, \u201cwhich amounts to 86 per cent of our annual requirement\u201d, he said. \u201cThis in itself shows how the surge in crude oil prices will increase the nation\u2019s overall expenditure, thus adversely affecting fiscal deficit.\u201d\n\nHis views are significant given that Brent crude oil is currently ruling around $80 a barrel and WTI crude oil near $77. Brent crude has gained 52 per cent this year, while overall crude oil is up 58 per cent year-to-date.\n\nCrude oil inventory is seven per cent below the five-year average.

    "cleaned_article": "Surging crude oil prices in the global market will push up the raw material cost of the agro-chemical sector as most of them are petrochemical derivatives, a senior Tata Chemicals official has said. \u201cFarmers will be forced to spend more, thereby severely impacting their earnings. On an overall basis, the energy price increase will have an inflationary effect,\u201d said Zarir Langrana, Executive Director and President (Global Chemicals Business), Tata Chemicals Limited. In August this year, India imported 17.4 million tonnes of crude oil, valued at $9.1 billion, \u201cwhich amounts to 86 per cent of our annual requirement\u201d, he said. \u201cThis in itself shows how the surge in crude oil prices will increase the nation\u2019s overall expenditure, thus adversely affecting fiscal deficit.\u201d His views are significant given that Brent crude oil is currently ruling around $80 a barrel and WTI crude oil near $77. Brent crude has gained 52 per cent this year, while overall crude oil is up 58 per cent year-to-date. Crude oil inventory is seven per cent below the five-year average.

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article highlights the impact of surging crude oil prices on India's fiscal deficit. It explicitly states that the increase in crude oil prices will \"adversely affect fiscal deficit\" by increasing the nation\u2019s overall expenditure. Given that India imports 86% of its crude oil requirements, higher oil prices will significantly raise import costs, putting pressure on government finances. Additionally, the article mentions inflationary effects due to rising energy prices, which could further strain fiscal management by increasing subsidy demands or reducing tax revenues in real terms. While the article does not provide specific fiscal deficit projections, the clear linkage between rising oil prices and higher government expenditure suggests a negative impact on the future fiscal deficit.  \n\n**",

This slowdown is attributed to both investment and consumption factors, including financial stress among rural households and weak job creation. Moody's also highlights that prolonged softer growth would dampen the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation plans and hamper its ability to prevent a rise in the debt burden. Additionally, the article mentions that the central government deficit is expected to be 3.7% of GDP in 2019-20, marking a 0.4 percentage point slippage from its target. These factors collectively indicate that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase in the near future due to lower tax revenues from slower growth and increased government spending to stimulate the economy.",

The reconsideration of this proposal suggests that the government may now rely more on domestic borrowing or rupee-denominated bonds in the overseas market. Increased domestic borrowing could lead to higher fiscal deficits in the future, as it may strain the domestic market and increase debt servicing costs. Additionally, the article mentions that the benchmark 10-year bond yield rose, indicating market concerns about higher government borrowing.

Market regulator wants increased disclosures and due diligence for initial public listings\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India has sent a 31-point advisory to investment bankers, requiring higher disclosures and increased due diligence on companies planning to tap the market through initial public offerings, the Hindu Businessline reported. Offer documents that do not conform with the guidelines will be returned, the regulator said to bankers in a mail.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The regulator\u2019s advisories typically address past missteps or lack of disclosures by companies. The fresh guidelines could make offer documents bulkier and push back IPO timelines.\n\n#2. Corporate India\u2019s net profits in March quarter grew the least in past five quarters\n\nThe combined net profits of listed firms, adjusted for exceptional gains and losses, rose 11.4 percent on year to Rs 3.56 lakh crore in the three months ended March, growing at the slowest pace in the last five quarters, the Business Standard reported. The combined net profits of 3,327 listed companies in the sample were up 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022-23 and increased 24.1 percent in the December quarter.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The growth in earnings was driven largely by the financial and auto sectors, but other firms in the oil and gas, IT and FMCG segments faced slowdown in both revenues and earnings.\n\n#3. Direct-to-consumer brands by business scions find favor with venture capital funds\n\nSeveral direct-to-consumer brands in sectors such as food and beverages, apparel, health and wellness, and founded by scions of families running traditional businesses in similar categories, are drawing significant amounts of venture funding, the Economic Times reported. These entrepreneurs with their understanding of the business and deep-rooted connections in the supply chain ecosystems are best placed to launch modern avatars of legacy businesses, investors backing them said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The importance of expertise and relationships these scions have built in their businesses before starting a new brand cannot be overstated. That said, there\u2019s something to be said for new-age entrepreneurs as well.\n\n#4. Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group likely to offload Paytm stake at a loss of up to $200 million\n\nThe SoftBank Group is likely to exit Paytm, posting investment losses in the range of $150-200 million, the Hindu Businessline reported. The investment firm\u2019s stake in the payments platform has declined to 1.4 percent at the end of March since it has been divesting stake over the past couple of years. It will likely exit the company this month, ending a 7-year association.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The exit of SoftBank from Paytm will drop the curtains on one of its biggest bets in India. It has earlier posted huge losses on its investments in Snapdeal and Ola.\n\n#5. High base effect and sizzling heat in May take big toll on car sales across India\n\nPassenger car dispatches to dealers rose moderately in May as the country\u2019s automobile market entered a period of seasonally slow sales, the Mint reported. Wholesale shipments in the month of May grew a modest 4.4 percent to cross 350,000 from a year earlier, data by manufacturers showed. This came after two consecutive years of record sales in 2023-24 and 2022-23.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The slower growth was somewhat expected as sizzling heatwaves in May kept buyers at home and the nation was busy with the general election. Sales might show an uptick from here on.\n\n#6. New government may pare fiscal deficit target on generous dividend payout by central bank\n\nThe new government may cut the fiscal deficit target for 2024-25 when it presents the full budget in July, encouraged by a better-than-expected deficit reading for the preceding financial year and the generous dividend payout from the Reserve Bank of India, the Economic times reported. In the interim budget in February, it had set the fiscal deficit goal at 5.1 percent of GDP and revised the 2023-24 target to 5.8 percent from the previously budgeted 5.9 percent.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The extra dividend from the Reserve Bank has created a space for a further reduction in the fiscal deficit. Regime continuity and robust economic growth is also helping.\n\n#7. Tamil Nadu like to be hub for electric vehicle exports by Tata Motors-Jaguar Land Rover\n\nTata Motors is likely to make Tamil Nadu a hub for exporting electric vehicles based on the Electrified Modular Architecture by Jaguar Land Rover, the Business Standard reported. While granular details around the models are not known, it is said that these could be JLR models made in India for export as well as Tata electric vehicles based on the EMA architecture.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The development follows French automaker Citroen deciding to export electric cars made in India to international markets, also from Tamil Nadu. Other global automakers might follow suit.\n\n#8. HCL Technologies\u2019 big bet on software products fails to achieve profitability targets\n\nHCL Technologies\u2019 bet on software products has not yielded profitability of the kind its management expected more than five years after the Noida-based firm acquired eight software products from IBM, the Mint reported. The business unit saw a 6.8 percentage point fall in operating margins from 2019-20 to 2023-24, despite a $271 million increase in revenue in the same period.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Profitability in software products business has been hit by volatility in perpetual license upfront, which is software license fees for on-premise software.

Net foreign direct investments sink to lowest since 2007 on minor stake sales\n\nNet foreign direct investment inflows at $10.6 billion in the year ended March fell to the lowest level since 2007, the Hindu Businessline reported. The high repatriation numbers were primarily led by foreign promoters, FDI investors and private equity and venture capital investors making the most of the sharp rally in the Indian stock market by selling minor parts of their stake.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The concerns about multinationals and foreign investors moving out of India seems overblown. The robust expansion of the economy points to a different story.\n\n#10. Online sales spike during high Indian summer as most customers choose to stay indoors\n\nOnline sales have surged during the recent heatwaves, with consumers opting to stay indoors to avoid the scorching heat and shop online instead, the Business Standard reported. The orders of ice creams, lassis, juices, and cold drinks reflect the harsh temperatures. Given that they are cooped up indoors, orders for books, games and snacks such as biscuits have also risen sharply.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The unbearable heat has provided a windfall opportunity to quick commerce platforms, which were already on a growth spurt.

    "cleaned_article": "Morning Scan #1. Market regulator wants increased disclosures and due diligence for initial public listings The Securities and Exchange Board of India has sent a 31-point advisory to investment bankers, requiring higher disclosures and increased due diligence on companies planning to tap the market through initial public offerings, the Hindu Businessline reported. Offer documents that do not conform with the guidelines will be returned, the regulator said to bankers in a mail. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Why it\u2019s important: The regulator\u2019s advisories typically address past missteps or lack of disclosures by companies. The fresh guidelines could make offer documents bulkier and push back IPO timelines. #2. Corporate India\u2019s net profits in March quarter grew the least in past five quarters The combined net profits of listed firms, adjusted for exceptional gains and losses, rose 11.4 percent on year to Rs 3.56 lakh crore in the three months ended March, growing at the slowest pace in the last five quarters, the Business Standard reported. The combined net profits of 3,327 listed companies in the sample were up 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022-23 and increased 24.1 percent in the December quarter. Why it\u2019s important: The growth in earnings was driven largely by the financial and auto sectors, but other firms in the oil and gas, IT and FMCG segments faced slowdown in both revenues and earnings. #3. Direct-to-consumer brands by business scions find favor with venture capital funds Several direct-to-consumer brands in sectors such as food and beverages, apparel, health and wellness, and founded by scions of families running traditional businesses in similar categories, are drawing significant amounts of venture funding, the Economic Times reported. These entrepreneurs with their understanding of the business and deep-rooted connections in the supply chain ecosystems are best placed to launch modern avatars of legacy businesses, investors backing them said. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Why it\u2019s important: The importance of expertise and relationships these scions have built in their businesses before starting a new brand cannot be overstated. That said, there\u2019s something to be said for new-age entrepreneurs as well. #4. Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group likely to offload Paytm stake at a loss of up to $200 million The SoftBank Group is likely to exit Paytm, posting investment losses in the range of $150-200 million, the Hindu Businessline reported. The investment firm\u2019s stake in the payments platform has declined to 1.4 percent at the end of March since it has been divesting stake over the past couple of years. It will likely exit the company this month, ending a 7-year association. Why it\u2019s important: The exit of SoftBank from Paytm will drop the curtains on one of its biggest bets in India. It has earlier posted huge losses on its investments in Snapdeal and Ola. #5. High base effect and sizzling heat in May take big toll on car sales across India Passenger car dispatches to dealers rose moderately in May as the country\u2019s automobile market entered a period of seasonally slow sales, the Mint reported. Wholesale shipments in the month of May grew a modest 4.4 percent to cross 350,000 from a year earlier, data by manufacturers showed. This came after two consecutive years of record sales in 2023-24 and 2022-23. Why it\u2019s important: The slower growth was somewhat expected as sizzling heatwaves in May kept buyers at home and the nation was busy with the general election. Sales might show an uptick from here on. #6. New government may pare fiscal deficit target on generous dividend payout by central bank The new government may cut the fiscal deficit target for 2024-25 when it presents the full budget in July, encouraged by a better-than-expected deficit reading for the preceding financial year and the generous dividend payout from the Reserve Bank of India, the Economic times reported. In the interim budget in February, it had set the fiscal deficit goal at 5.1 percent of GDP and revised the 2023-24 target to 5.8 percent from the previously budgeted 5.9 percent. Why it\u2019s important: The extra dividend from the Reserve Bank has created a space for a further reduction in the fiscal deficit. Regime continuity and robust economic growth is also helping. #7. Tamil Nadu like to be hub for electric vehicle exports by Tata Motors-Jaguar Land Rover Tata Motors is likely to make Tamil Nadu a hub for exporting electric vehicles based on the Electrified Modular Architecture by Jaguar Land Rover, the Business Standard reported. While granular details around the models are not known, it is said that these could be JLR models made in India for export as well as Tata electric vehicles based on the EMA architecture. Why it\u2019s important: The development follows French automaker Citroen deciding to export electric cars made in India to international markets, also from Tamil Nadu. Other global automakers might follow suit. #8. HCL Technologies\u2019 big bet on software products fails to achieve profitability targets HCL Technologies\u2019 bet on software products has not yielded profitability of the kind its management expected more than five years after the Noida-based firm acquired eight software products from IBM, the Mint reported. The business unit saw a 6.8 percentage point fall in operating margins from 2019-20 to 2023-24, despite a $271 million increase in revenue in the same period. Why it\u2019s important: Profitability in software products business has been hit by volatility in perpetual license upfront, which is software license fees for on-premise software. The company\u2019s brand value may allow the segment to grow, albeit modestly. #9. Net foreign direct investments sink to lowest since 2007 on minor stake sales Net foreign direct investment inflows at $10.6 billion in the year ended March fell to the lowest level since 2007, the Hindu Businessline reported. The high repatriation numbers were primarily led by foreign promoters, FDI investors and private equity and venture capital investors making the most of the sharp rally in the Indian stock market by selling minor parts of their stake.

This suggests a potential reduction in the fiscal deficit, supported by robust economic growth and regime continuity.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights the importance of accelerating vaccination efforts to support economic recovery in India. It also mentions that manufacturing and construction activities are expected to face a softer economic shock in the April-June quarter due to state-imposed restrictions. However, the finance ministry acknowledges that the second wave of Covid-19 and associated restrictions pose a downside risk to economic recovery in the first quarter of FY22. While the article does not explicitly discuss future fiscal deficit, the implied economic slowdown and potential need for continued government spending on healthcare and economic support measures suggest a possible increase in fiscal deficit. This aligns with a negative outlook on future fiscal deficit direction.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses the government's actions to address the GST compensation cess shortfall by providing loans to states and union territories. While the Finance Ministry explicitly states that these borrowings will not impact the fiscal deficit of the central government, the broader context suggests potential future fiscal pressures. The government has announced plans to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore under a special window to meet GST revenue shortfalls, and it has allowed states to raise additional funds through open market borrowings to address revenue deficits caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures indicate increased borrowing and financial support to states, which could indirectly strain the central government's fiscal position in the future. Although the article does not explicitly predict an increase in the fiscal deficit, the cumulative effect of these actions hints at potential fiscal challenges ahead.",

He said the trial court judgement was a part of the legal process that allowed him to appeal against it and seek bail. 09:30 Pakistan has added 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed\u2019s Jamaat-ud-Dawah to its updated list of banned outfits, an inclusion prompted by the United States\u2019 decision to suspend approximately USD 2 billion in security assistance to Islamabad. Apart from JuD, Saeed\u2019s so-called charity Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation is also among the 72 banned outfits on the list released by the country\u2019s Interior Ministry, the Express Tribune reported.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article contains several elements that could influence future fiscal deficits. Notably, the government's approval of the construction of 14,000 bunkers along the Line of Control and International Border suggests increased infrastructure spending, which could lead to higher expenditures. Additionally, the mention of potential relaxed fiscal deficit targets in the upcoming budget, as indicated by Icra's managing director, implies that the government may allow for a higher deficit to accommodate increased spending, particularly in sectors like agriculture and small businesses. These factors collectively suggest a potential increase in the fiscal deficit.",

Conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, apart from being environmentally unsustainable, have now also become financially unviable for a large section of the Indian population.\n\nAs a result, vehicle owners across India are wondering if they would be better off in making the switch to greener, more sustainable modes of transportation.

For instance, the Government has slashed the GST on EVs to 5 per cent to make them more affordable and will provide capital grants to organisations \u2013 such as delivery companies and e-commerce players \u2013 that promote EV adoption. It also approved the installation of more than 2,600 EV charging stations, with the aim to provide EV charging facilities every 25 kilometres to address range anxiety.\n\nThe Union Budget 2021-22 also had several promising proposals for India\u2019s EV landscape, with a financial outlay of Rs 18,000 crore to operate more than 20,000 EV buses under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. In a 2020 proposal, the NITI Aayog recommended promoting large-scale EV battery manufacturing within the country by offering financial incentives to the tune of $4.6 billion until 2030. These measures, if and when implemented, will not only bolster EV adoption across public and private modes of transportation but will also encourage local production of electric vehicles, batteries, and relevant components \u2013 ultimately bringing down the cost of owning and operating an EV.\n\nFuelling the EV adoption: Rising fuel prices, government conundrum to drive EV adoption?\n\nThe biggest factor in the favour of mass EV adoption in the country, however, will be the rising fuel prices. When the per-barrel price for crude oil dropped to a historic global low in April 2020 in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Government did not revise fuel prices to reflect the reduction. Instead, it increased the excise duty levied on fossil fuels such as diesel and petrol to reduce the fiscal deficit.\n\nNow, with global oil prices for crude and refined products registering massive gains over the last couple of weeks, the base price for fossil fuel has increased substantially, driving the sudden hike in the retail petrol and diesel prices across India. With this oil rally expected to continue, at least for the foreseeable future, the only way that the Government can bring down oil prices is by reducing the taxes applied to retail petrol and diesel.

    "deficit_analysis": "**ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article discusses the Indian government's efforts to promote electric vehicles (EVs) through various policy measures, such as tax deductions, GST reductions, capital grants, and infrastructure investments. While these initiatives aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and encourage EV adoption, they also imply significant government spending. The article mentions a financial outlay of Rs 18,000 crore for EV buses and a proposed $4.6 billion in incentives for EV battery manufacturing until 2030. Additionally, the government faces a conundrum with rising fuel prices, as reducing taxes on petrol and diesel to alleviate consumer burden could worsen the fiscal deficit, which was already at Rs 11.6 trillion by December 2020. The article suggests that the government is unlikely to reduce fuel taxes due to the fiscal deficit concerns, but the increased spending on EV incentives and infrastructure could further strain the deficit. While the long-term benefits of EV adoption might eventually reduce fiscal pressures, the immediate and medium-term",

Those expectations played out last week, with the Reserve Bank of India raising the benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2014. At the same time, foreign funds \u2014 which typically buy short-duration notes \u2014 have dumped Indian securities amid a global rout. Bond underwriters have rescued four government auctions in the year that began April 1, by stepping in to buy unsold short-term notes.\n\nAll this has prompted a rethink from the government, which earlier said it planned to issue more of the shorter debt in the first half of this fiscal year. It reduced planned issuance of 10-14 year bonds to 29 percent of total borrowing for the period, compared with more than 50 percent in previous years. \u201cWe increased our offering in the shorter end quite a lot, but the demand which we expected didn\u2019t appear to be coming,\u201d Garg said.\n\nWhile overseas funds are fleeing, matters have been made worse by reduced participation by state-run banks \u2014 the biggest holders of sovereign securities \u2014 who are unwilling to buy the debt after having suffered billions of rupees in losses on their investments. The benchmark 10-year yield rose above 8 percent last week for the first time since May 2015. Banks probably find the yields attractive now, Garg said, adding that there has been strong demand from lenders in the last few weeks. Higher \u201cbase yields\u201d will also lead to an increase in the small savings rates from the next quarter, he said. The 10-year yield has increased 56 basis points since the end of March to 7.96 percent, lagging the 75 basis point advance in the two-year rate to 7.60 percent.\n\nFiscal Deficit\n\nWhile bond investors are concerned surging oil prices will worsen public finances in the oil-importing nation, Garg said that \u201cso far there\u2019s no adverse impact of crude prices on the fiscal side.\u201d India\u2019s budget deficit is still one of the widest in Asia and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s challenge is to narrow it further amid pressures to boost spending ahead of national polls in 2019. His government aims to narrow the gap to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year, from 3.5 percent in the year ended March 31. \u201cAt this moment, we are completely confident of meeting the fiscal deficit target,\u201d he said.\n\nThe finance ministry is in discussions with the central bank on a new formula for transfer of the RBI\u2019s dividend to the government, Garg said. \u201cWe have been discussing the issue of capital with the RBI and that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a certain way in which the surplus is transferred. That was changed last year. They transferred some money to reserves. The government would like entire surplus.\u201d\n\nAIIB Funding\n\nGarg said India expects to continue receiving funds from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2014 a multilateral investment bank proposed by China that started operations in 2016 \u2014 as the nation needs to spend $4.5 trillion on its infrastructure by 2040. \u201cIndia might be the biggest borrower of AIIB in 2018 as well,\u201d Garg said, adding that the lender approved funding for about $1.2 billion worth of projects in India in 2017, which made up about 30 percent of its total lending. \u201cWe would try to see that they approve projects of $1 billion for India every year, but I understand they also have some capacity constraints,\u201d he said, ahead of AIIB\u2019s annual meeting in Mumbai this month.",

His government aims to narrow the gap to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year, from 3.5 percent in the year ended March 31. \u201cAt this moment, we are completely confident of meeting the fiscal deficit target,\u201d he said. The finance ministry is in discussions with the central bank on a new formula for transfer of the RBI\u2019s dividend to the government, Garg said. \u201cWe have been discussing the issue of capital with the RBI and that\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a certain way in which the surplus is transferred. That was changed last year. They transferred some money to reserves. The government would like entire surplus.\u201d AIIB Funding Garg said India expects to continue receiving funds from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \u2014 a multilateral investment bank proposed by China that started operations in 2016 \u2014 as the nation needs to spend $4.5 trillion on its infrastructure by 2040. \u201cIndia might be the biggest borrower of AIIB in 2018 as well,\u201d Garg said, adding that the lender approved funding for about $1.2 billion worth of projects in India in 2017, which made up about 30 percent of its total lending. \u201cWe would try to see that they approve projects of $1 billion for India every year, but I understand they also have some capacity constraints,\u201d he said, ahead of AIIB\u2019s annual meeting in Mumbai this month.",

    "deficit_analysis": "ANALYSIS: The article provides mixed signals regarding the future fiscal deficit of India. On one hand, Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Garg expresses confidence in meeting the fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP for the current fiscal year, down from 3.5% in the previous year. This suggests a commitment to fiscal discipline and a potential decrease in the deficit. Additionally, discussions with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) about transferring the RBI\u2019s entire surplus to the government could provide additional fiscal space, further supporting deficit reduction.\n\nOn the other hand, there are concerns about rising oil prices, which could strain public finances given India\u2019s status as a major oil importer. While Garg states that there has been no adverse impact on the fiscal side so far, the potential for future pressure remains. Furthermore, the government\u2019s ambitious infrastructure spending plans, including borrowing from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), could increase fiscal obligations in the long term.",

In the Union Budget, the central government presents the proposed financial objectives and policy updates for that year. Several Union Budgets presented under different governments are remembered for their landmark decisions and policy announcements. Here are the top remarkable Union Budgets of India.\n\nThe Black Budget The Union Budget was presented by Yashwantrao B Chavan during the Indira Gandhi government in the year 1973-74. It was termed the Black Budget because of the high fiscal deficit of \u20b9550 crore during that year, according to PTI. The nation was going through acute financial hardships at that time.\n\nCarrot and Stick Budget Presented by then Finance Minister VP Singh, the Union Budget of 1986 was called as \u2018Carrot & Stick\u2019 Budget because it was the first step towards demolishing the licence raj in India.\n\nThe Budget presented in 1986 earned the name because of its dual nature. On the one hand, the government introduced the MODVAT (Modified Value Added Tax) credit to lower the cascading effect of tax that consumers had to pay, on the other hand, it also launched an intense drive against smugglers, black marketers, and tax evaders.\n\nEpochal Budget of 1991 The economic reforms introduced by the central government in the year made it one of the most iconic budgets presented so far. Presented by Manmohan Singh in 1991, the budget was the final blow to end licence raj. Moreover, it brought the era of liberalisation. Hence, it is famously known as the \u2018Epochal budget\u2019, according to PTI.\n\nThe budget was presented at a time when India was on the verge of an economic collapse. In that year, the government significantly reduced customs duty from 220 per cent to 150 per cent and took steps to promote exports.\n\nDream Budget Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram announced a significant tax cut while presenting the Union Budget in 1998. He slashed the maximum marginal income rate for individuals from 40 per cent to 30 per cent and that for domestic companies to 35 per cent. Apart from these measures, the government also announced a voluntary disclosure of income scheme to recover black money. In that year, the government also trimmed customs duty to 40 per cent.\n\nMillennium Budget The Union Budget presented by Yashwant Sinha presented the road map for the growth of the Information Technology (IT) industry of the country. To boost the Indian sector, it also phased out incentives on software exporters and lowered customs duty on 21 items like computers and computer accessories.\n\nRollback Budget The budget presented by Yashwant Sinha during the NDA government in the year 2002-03 was famously called as the Rollback Budget. It earned this name because of the withdrawal of several proposals and policies by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article primarily provides a historical overview of notable Union Budgets in India and does not explicitly discuss future fiscal deficit projections or policy changes. It mentions that the upcoming interim budget is unlikely to include major announcements or policy changes due to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, which suggests a status quo approach in the short term. However, there is no clear indication of future government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would directly impact the fiscal deficit. The absence of specific information about future fiscal measures makes it difficult to predict the direction of the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the article is neutral regarding future fiscal deficit implications.",

    "full_article": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what could be considered as a less enthusiastic view on India\u2019s debt sustainability, Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) kept India\u2019s sovereign rating unchanged at BBB-, evoking rather ambivalent reactions compared with those that followed the rating upgrade by Moody\u2019s to Baa2 from Baa3 on November, 16, 2017.The response to Moody\u2019s upgrade was fairly jubilant with G-sec yield declining, as participants extrapolated it to justify lower credit spread and equity indices rose by 1-2 per cent. But, the exuberance will likely fade following S&P\u2019s cautious assessment of India. The difference in assessment of the two rating agencies is stark.But first, let\u2019s look at the similarities. Both the agencies foresee stronger GDP growth of approximately 7.5-7.6 per cent over the forecast horizon of next few years. The slowdown to 6.5-6.6 per cent caused by demonetisation and GST implementation-led disruptions is seen as short-term disturbances, beyond which growth is expected to rebound.While Moody\u2019s attributed the impending growth revival to multiple reform measures taken up by the government recently, S&P linked it to stronger consumption growth, comfortably high foreign currency reserves, political stability and robust democratic institutions.The key difference is the optimistic view taken by Moody\u2019s on debt sustainability. While the agency acknowledges that the general public debt-GDP ratio at 68 per cent is high compared with the peers\u2019 median average of 44 per cent, it has pre-empted a scenario of declining debt-GDP ratio over time. This is notwithstanding its expectation of a rise of 1 per cent in the ratio in view of the slowdown caused by near-term domestic shocks.In contrasting, S&P is concerned about sovereign debt sustainability of both central as well as state governments. In particular, the agency foresees the fiscal situation of the state governments worsening, i.e. likely addition of 3 per cent on average to the consolidated general government deficit over the forecast horizon till 2020.The less optimistic picture painted by S&P, especially pertaining to the persistently high deficit at state levels, large general public debt and overall weak public finances is sharply divergent to the declining debt-GDP trajectory projected by Moody\u2019s. The key constraint to India\u2019s rating cited by S&P are the high level of debt, elevated fiscal deficit , and low per capital income and wealth Where does this contrasting assessment lead us to?The key question to answer is: whether India has grown strongly enough to have crossed the hump of debt burden? Evidences are less convincing.Does it not look paradoxical that India\u2019s productive private sector continues to flounder on debt repayment despite the economy estimated to be growing at over 7 per cent (FY15-18), as reflected in non-performing loans (NPAs) rising in excess of 40 per cent per annum during the times of high GDP growth?A weak corporate performance is evident from the fact that corporate profits have hardly grown over the past four years. The disconcerting aspect is that post 2007-08 global financial crisis, the average growth in Indian corporate profit has been a meagre 1.5 per cent (as per CMIE data base) compared with a robust 35 per cent in the previous seven years.For Nifty companies, the post-crisis average is somewhat better at 5 per cent. Debt repayment capability of the general government cannot be detached from the broader economic performance, especially more productive components such as private sector and banks, farm economy etc. All these are currently facing heightened debt sustainability problems.The impaired assets of the public sector banks (PSBs) are currently estimated at around Rs10 lakh crore, including around Rs7 lakh crore of gross non-performing loans (GNPAs). Likewise, corporate balance sheets are still quite leveraged. Together, they constitute the twin balance-sheet problem hampering faster recovery in economic growth.The indebtedness and debt sustainability concerns have got elevated in the aftermath of shocks like demonetisation and GST-related dislocations, with the informal and farm sectors taking a major hit in particular.The avalanche of farm sector loan waivers estimated at Rs 2.2-2.7 lakh crore, stress in the MSME sector and weak corporate earnings growth reflect the decline in productivity across these sectors. For instance, the farm sector has been facing declining terms of trade by 7 per cent since 2012, indicating weaker price realisations relative to the cost of cultivation. The negative shocks caused by demonetisation worsened the net income for the farm sector, translating into greater farm loan defaults.For non-finance corporates, return on gross fixed assets has declined to a historically low level of 5-6 per cent (FY15-16) from a peak of 22 per cent notched in FY07-08. Return on capital employed has also declined sharply from 10 per cent to 3 per cent. Return on assets (RoA) for the Nifty50 companies have declined to a low of just 2.5 per cent compared with the peak of approximately 7 per cent recorded in 2007. All these indicate declining productivity of capital along with elevated debt-equity (DE) ratio.Policy responses like bank recapitalisation at central government level, farm loan waivers by state governments and conversion of loans of electricity boards into state loans are in-principal nationalisation of failed private debt.Given that we are still at the beginning of the thawing process of private sector debt, requiring more fiscal responses (both by way of fiscal stimulus and direct absorption of private bad debt), there is a significant probability of public debt/GDP ratio rising in the foreseeable future. Considering the bank recapitalization program and farm loan waivers alone, the additional public debt burden could be ~3-3.5% of GDP.Study of past economic cycles in India suggests that crossing the hump of public debt-GDP cycle would require a confluence of following constructive factors.First, a lasting resolution of private sector NPAs must be found (and that too urgently), including proactive debt restructuring, change of management, sale of assets (at prices that makes projects viable in future), continued deleveraging etc.Second, substantial haircuts on impaired loans by banks accompanied by aggressive banking sector restructuring.Third, resuscitation of productivity of capital.Fourth, a sustainable economic recovery, both domestic as well as global (including revival in domestic savings rates).Moody\u2019s rating upgrade action hinges on the conclusion of some of the pending reforms. While there is some merit in taking a long-term positive view of these developments, the fact that India has been on a perpetual reform path, these reforms may not be the sufficient basis to take a pre-emptive positive view of declining public debt-GDP ratio, especially when based on its own assessment Moody\u2019s is projecting the ratio to rise further during its forecast horizon.In addition, it appears that a cyclical rise in real GDP growth to 7.5-7.6 per cent, projected by the rating agencies, may also not be sufficient for such an optimistic projection given that the debt and fiscal sustainability concerns have been on the rise in the recent past even amid higher average real GDP growth of 7.8 per cent during FY15-FY17.It is important to note that the combined fiscal deficit of central and state governments declined only modestly by 30bps to 6.5 per cent of GDP in FY17 over the previous 3 years despite the bounty of declining global crude oil prices and disproportionate hike in excise duty on petroleum products.Clearly, S&P\u2019s position, taking cognizance of the still vulnerable fiscal scenario, appears more realistic than Moody\u2019s optimism. My assessment of the broader economy, including the twin balance sheet problems, corporate profitability, employment scenario and farm sector vulnerability outlines pervasive debt sustainability issues. Therefore, the compulsions of committing greater fiscal support, before a sustainable growth cycle gets re-established, is far greater today than before.",

We have seen a mild reversal in India in February. We are getting into some uncharted territory. At this moment, FPIs are in a wait-and-watch mode. While they will continue to invest, it is more a question of allocation, i.e, how much they are going to invest in emerging markets.This is a one-off event and has not impacted the overall system. At least, investors believe so. There is no concern from anybody and people are investing in normal course. Overall, on a macro basis, nothing has changed for dent investor confidence.There is a high possibility. They may decide in April. It may be increased gradually.FPIs enjoy much higher investment limit in other emerging markets. The investment appetite for Indian debt assets is pretty strong among global investors. It is time we see an increase in investment cap as the country\u2019s economy has just begun to show up amid political stability.India\u2019s imports from the US are not significant. The real threat is from China, which is our emerging market competitor. If the Trump tariff causes any global trade war influencing the currency market, India cannot remain immune to global currency moves. But, there is no direct correlation.The dollar rates have gone up. In the first month itself (this year), dollar yields (UST) are higher by 50 basis points. It is impacting the dollar credit now, which is impacting foreign currency borrowing costs for Indian corporates.In India, bond markets have already seen a very large impact in the last six months. There is huge uncertainty in global markets, especially in context of the withdrawal of stimulus in the developed world, especially the US and Europe. We will react as and when the situation develops. This time, the synchronisation in world yields is quite high.The underlying economics of trades for emerging markets is how much they are able to fund in dollars. Base rates have gone up. For example, six-month LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offer Rate) is now about 1.5%, which used to be 50 basis points only a year back. Beyond that, it is the spread that they charge. You get money after adding 100 or 200 basis points over LIBOR. If global liquidity tightens, the cost of funding will also go up.Logically, if you get 8% and funding cost is 3.50%, you say, what is my hedging cost? Some people leave it open while others hedge it. On complete hedge basis, there is a positive carry of 100 basis points as of now. Till the time this positive carry remains, the trade will carry on. If the cost of carry goes up, you may see inflows getting hit.We are going to have a current account deficit, which is expected to be 1.5-2% for the next year with high oil prices, commodity prices and other imports. The rupee is expected to depreciate 3-3.5% per year with the widening current account deficit.Our MPC highlighted inflation risk. Fed is hinting at more rate hikes. The dollar strength has come back after the Fed minutes and Jerome Powell\u2019s statement. End result is that the dollar has strengthened. From hereon we might see a mild weakening bias on rupee.The RBI may stay put for another six months or so. I do not expect any large move in the repo rate in the near future. This year the repo rate is at 6%. The benchmark yield has moved up 100 basis points even after the repo rate cut.The GDP growth for next year is expected to be between 7.25% and 7.50%, and the inflation trajectory seems to be averaging 4.5-5.0%. In that scenario, the repo rate might be stable for an extended period of time. The risk to this view is if inflation overshoots the RBI\u2019s trajectory, they might have to tighten the policy.The banking system is also holding excess SLR, which is eating into demand side unless there is palpable credit growth.One of the impediments that happened is that deposits have not grown fast enough last year due to remonetisation. We will be back to normal from April when new auctions begin. If the deposits and credit pickups are in commensuration with each other, we should see 15-16% growth in deposits and 10-11% growth in credit.If we are back to those numbers then the government\u2019s borrowing programme will also sell well. With deposit creation, you will have incremental demand for SLR bonds. The incremental money gets parked in government bonds.I have my doubts. You run commercial banks. From April, your deposits growth may hover around 14-15%, while credit may grow at 7-8%, as it usually is a lean season with no significant demand for loans. What will you do with the money? Whenever yields rise, there is always a pain in the banking system due to the losses on the existing portfolio, but these are all temporary phases as economic rational gets into play.

In the short run, banks\u2019 apathy to buy papers matter, but it would not sustain in the medium run with commercial decisions. There is demand from LIC.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses various economic factors such as foreign portfolio investment (FPI) appetite, global market uncertainties, and India's current account deficit, but it does not directly address future fiscal deficit direction. However, there are indirect implications. The mention of a current account deficit of 1.5-2% for the next year, driven by high oil and commodity prices, suggests potential pressure on government finances. Additionally, the expectation of rupee depreciation and inflation risks could further strain fiscal management. While the article does not explicitly predict an increase in the fiscal deficit, these factors hint at potential challenges that could lead to a higher deficit. Therefore, the article leans slightly toward a negative outlook for future fiscal deficit.",

This increase in spending is expected to widen the budget deficit. Additionally, the Finance Minister\u2019s $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment plan, with federal and state governments contributing at least 75%, indicates significant future fiscal commitments.

The imports stood at USD 35 billion in 2022-23. Agarwal said the government should also divest its equity in Hindustan Copper Ltd, the sole miner of copper in the country.

Hindustan Copper is under the administrative control of Ministry of Mines. It is the only company in India engaged in mining of copper ore and owns all the operating mining lease of copper ore and also the only integrated producer of refined copper.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses proposals to reduce customs duty on gold and privatize state-owned gold and copper mines. While these measures could potentially reduce gold imports and save foreign exchange, the immediate fiscal impact is uncertain. The reduction in customs duty might lead to a short-term decrease in tax revenue, which could slightly increase the fiscal deficit. However, the long-term benefits of privatization and reduced imports could improve fiscal health. The article does not provide a clear, direct prediction about the future fiscal deficit, but the proposed changes suggest a potential for both negative and positive impacts. Overall, the implications for the future fiscal deficit are mixed and not strongly conclusive.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights a significant slowdown in India's economic growth, with GDP growth projections revised downward to 4% for FY 2019-20. This slowdown is attributed to a contraction in key sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and core industries, as well as a decline in merchandise exports and gross tax revenue. The lockdown further exacerbated these challenges, leading to a sharp decline in economic activity in the final quarter. While there are some signs of recovery in February 2020, the overall economic outlook remains weak. Lower GDP growth typically translates to reduced tax revenues, which, combined with potential increases in government spending to stimulate the economy, could lead to a higher fiscal deficit in the future. The article does not explicitly mention government spending plans or fiscal policy changes, but the economic conditions described suggest a likely increase in the fiscal deficit.",

Reducing the tax slabs does make perfect sense. It would simplify the tax system: make it transparent, efficient and tax payer-friendly.We currently have four slabs fixed for GST, a low rate of 5 per cent, two standard rates of 12 per cent and 18 per cent, and a high rate of 28 per cent. It would make sense to drop middling 12 per cent and 18 per cent rates and opt for 16 per cent as the standard rate to be levied on most items. It would also be desirable to reduce the peak rate.Note that apart from the four-rate slab structure in the GST regime, we also have 0 per cent on certain items of mass consumption, 3 per cent on gold and jewellery, and additional cess on high-end consumption items like automobiles.The government needs to put out a discussion paper on how it proposes to go about reducing the GST slabs and lowering the rates. The way forward is to have three slabs in the GST structure, and prune the rates at either end. We need to boost tax buoyancy, but also make sure that there is revenue neutrality. Tax revenue must of course not be adversely affected in the changeover to the new indirect tax regime.The way ahead is to have 16 per cent as the standard GST rate, by fusing the two rates of 12 per cent and 18 per cent. It would reduce classification disputes and put paid to lobbying for reduced tax rates. It would also be as per international norms.A couple of years ago, an expert committee report on the revenue neutral GST rate noted that the standard rate in the high-income economies was estimated at 16.8 per cent. A standard rate of 16 per cent would also be in line with the rates of taxation in ancient India.As per Kautilya\u2019s Arthashastra, the median tax rate mentioned in the treatise was 16.33 per cent. So a standard rate of 16 per cent would be in line with current history and also reflect the going rates from over two thousand years ago!The low GST rate of 5 per cent may also need to be pruned to 4 per cent. That on gold can well be nudged to 4 per cent (instead of 3 per cent at present), so that most products are covered under the two rates of 4 per cent and 16 per cent. In tandem, there\u2019s the need to have somewhat lower tax on luxury goods and high-end consumption items.The peak GST rate of 28 per cent needs to be purposefully reduced. Given that the peak direct tax is proposed to be reduced to 25 per cent, it would make sense to likewise reduce the highest indirect tax slab from 28 per cent to 24 per cent. So the three tax GST slabs can be structured as follows, 4 per cent, 16 per cent and 24 per cent.In parallel, we need to modernise the indirect tax structure for petroleum products. Such products provide bountiful tax revenue of about Rs 5 lakh crore to the exchequer, and for the most part, remain outside the GST regime. Instead of taxing petro-products to the hilt, the tax base clearly needs to be widened. We must not depend heavily and disproportionately on just one revenue item: oil.",

This suggests a proactive approach to controlling spending and maintaining the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% for FY22. While the article does not explicitly predict the future fiscal deficit beyond FY22, the emphasis on fiscal discipline and adherence to spending limits implies a cautious approach that could help in maintaining or even reducing the fiscal deficit in the future. However, since there is no explicit prediction or indication of a significant decrease in the fiscal deficit, the score remains neutral with a slight positive inclination.",

The GST council is yet to decide which goods fall in which slab. The GST rates will remain broadly in line with the existing rates.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on state revenues and the need for central compensation for certain states. While it mentions that GST will bring efficiency gains and have a positive impact on state finances in the medium to long term, it also highlights that 11 states will require an additional Rs 9,500 crore in compensation from the Centre in FY18. This suggests an increase in central government expenditure to support these states, which could contribute to a higher fiscal deficit. Although the article does not explicitly predict the overall fiscal deficit, the need for additional compensation hints at potential upward pressure on the deficit.",

Such a target is well beyond any reasonable contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation India may be expected to make.

Nevertheless, national policymakers have to consider whether this target is economically feasible.The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF) in association with IIT Bombay (IITB), and McKinsey Global Institute recently looked at this question through quantitative modelling. Teri and McKinsey looked at a timeframe of 2050, and VIF-IITB at 2070.Teri's internal study made the critical assumption that the social discount rate is zero. It employed the engineering-economic MARKAL (market allocation) model. This mimics a central planner tasked with finding a mix of energy supply and demand technologies that would meet the energy requirements of all final demand commodities in the economy at least energy system cost over a specified planning horizon.It assumed that GDP growth rates would be at 6.37% (2020-25), gradually falling to 3.5% (2045-50). Different technologies for GHG mitigation would reach commercialisation at different times and introduction into the system. The result was startling. The incremental (undiscounted) investment to reach near net-zero would total $113 trillion over the period. India's current GDP is about $3 trillion.The VIF/IITB study employs a different model, TIMES - The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM (Energy Flow Optimisation Model) 1 System - that also assumes a central planner who minimises the energy system cost to meet final demands of commodities in the economy. This model includes an hourly profile of energy demand, and the choice of energy technology at each time slice given various engineering constraints. It also permits the modeller to simulate scenarios with different mixes of technologies, and different GHG peaking years.Crucially, the study assumes a social discount rate of 9%. No explicit GDP growth rates over 2020-70 were assumed. Instead, the energy demand in 2070 was estimated by considering the historical trends in increase in energy demand, decline in energy intensity of the economy, and the technical maximum share of electricity in the energy mix. The least-cost power generation mix in 2070, with emissions peaking in 2050, is 5% renewables and 95% nuclear. This is a very different proposition from the current focus on solar.The energy system cost of the transition is $11.2 trillion, and the incremental investment cost is $6 trillion.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses the significant costs associated with decarbonisation policies in India, with incremental investment costs ranging from $6 trillion to $113 trillion depending on the scenario and timeframe. These costs are substantial relative to India's current GDP of $3 trillion. The article suggests that meeting these costs could strain domestic savings, potentially halting growth in other productive and social infrastructure investments. Alternatively, relying on external financing could lead to rupee appreciation, reduced exports, increased imports, and higher public debt due to expensive commercial finance. These factors indicate that the government may face increased fiscal pressures to fund decarbonisation efforts, likely leading to a higher fiscal deficit in the future. The article does not provide any clear indication of measures to reduce the fiscal deficit, instead highlighting the challenges and costs associated with decarbonisation.",

In this difficult-to-read pandemic year, it\u2019s a problem Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman must contend with as she prepares to present her third budget on Monday. In a highly informal economy, where unorganised sector and millions of self-employed dominate the landscape, data is perpetually scarce and statistical clarity poor. This has only worsened in a virus-ravaged year when data gets distorted and any comparison looks inherently flawed.In this inscrutable year, on the eve of the crucial Budget 2021 , ET Magazine has tried to take stock of something pertinent, something the government should keep in mind: what do people want? ET Magazine conducted a three tier poll \u2014 of 100 CEOs, 27 economists and 3,476 middle-class Indians (readers of www. economictimes.com) \u2014 over a fortnight in January to better understand the year gone by, where India is today and do some crystal-gazing into the future. What do they want from this budget? How do they look at this long pandemic period? How do they see the government\u2019s handling of crucial issues and what more do they expect? The survey format allowed for anonymity, so that respondents could speak their mind.The results are revealing. Expectedly, CEOs, economists and citizens differ in their responses. But there is near-unanimity on two important aspects. One, most of them agree that the government has done a good job of handling the pandemic crisis and the vaccine rollout. This should offer some comfort to the Narendra Modi sarkar as globally, governments, from the US to Sweden, have made many missteps amid high rates of Covid-19 infection and mortality.Two, there is near-alignment on what the three sections are worried about the most \u2014 jobs . Many believe India is staring at a job-income crisis, which is far bigger than the pandemic-triggered health crisis. Both experts and aam aadmi concur on this. \u201cTravel and tourism industry has been devastated. There is huge job and income loss,\u201d says Deep Kalra, cofounder of MakeMyTrip, about the industry that employs over 80 million people.\u201cCasualty is very high in the sector, which is dominated by small, unorganised players. We have cried ourselves hoarse but there is no response (from the government). We are disillusioned.\u201d The report card for the government varies, depending on who is grading. Economists have been the harshest critics, with just 4% assessing the government\u2019s performance as excellent, while 32% each give it good, average and bad ratings.CEOs have graded the government a tad better \u2014 8% rate it excellent, 44% good, 37% average and just 11% bad. Among the middle class, 12% give it an excellent grade, 34% good, 35% average and 19% bad. \u201cThe government has managed well in a tough year. We must give credit where it is due,\u201d says Rashesh Shah, chairman, Edelweiss Group. Agrees Patu Keswani of Lemon Tree Hotels: \u201cI am happy with the way the government has responded. Remember, this is from someone whose sector has been badly affected.\u201dInterestingly, a big chunk of all three categories of respondents \u2014 72% CEOs, 76% economists and 55% of middle-class Indians \u2014 wants the budget to boost spending and investment. And how have things been at home? Amid the pandemic, work from home (WFH) has led to longer work hours for most people and heightened loneliness for some. The crisis has also forced the majority to reset life expectations even as they tackle headwinds in their professional lives.India has been facing headwinds for quite some time. Much before Covid, experts were worrying about slowing economic growth, muted sentiments, poor investment and falling jobs. All of these worsened over the past year. \u201cEven before the pandemic, the government was fiscally stressed. After that, it didn\u2019t have much fiscal space,\u201d says Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings.Last year, when rich countries loosened their purse strings to roll out generous stimulus programmes, India too unveiled a headline-grabbing plan of Rs 30 lakh crore across multiple trances. It outlined many measures, including AtmaNirbhar Bharat programmes and performance-linked incentives, boost for domestic manufacturing, improved credit access for enterprises, moratorium on interest payments and thrust on affordable housing and MNREGA. But in both intent and reality, it fell far short of everyone\u2019s expectations. Partly, this tight-fistedness has been attributed to the government\u2019s concerns on rising fiscal deficit.\u201cThe government has held back public expenditure,\u201d says former chief statistician and economist Pronab Sen. Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, CRISIL India, says, \u201cAn interesting feature of India\u2019s sharp economic recovery has been that it happened without too much government support.\u201d Among the economists who took part in the ET Magazine poll, only 5% say the government handled the economy well.Jahangir Aziz, global head EM, Economic & Commodities Research, JP Morgan, says not only did the Indian government overreact with the world\u2019s most stringent lockdown but it did not follow it up with an adequate fiscal stimulus to aid economic recovery. \u201cThe question to ask is \u2014 by showing fiscal rectitude in a year when India\u2019s GDP growth rate was the worst in its recorded history, has the government impaired India\u2019s medium-term economic growth?\u201d asks Aziz.On the eve of the budget, another question to ask is what should its focus be. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings, says the government should just keep things grounded in reality. \u201cMake it a credible budget. Don\u2019t overstate income like non-tax revenue and disinvestment proceeds,\u201d he says.Economists who took part in the survey are divided on what should be the thrust of the budget: while 35% say the FM should maintain fiscal discipline, 30% urge Sitharaman to borrow more.Through the mist, a few things are becoming clearer: the disparity is becoming deeper. As Joshi of CRISIL India says, \u201cIt (the economic recovery) has been a story of two halves.\u201d On one side, green shoots are emerging. The IMF has revised India\u2019s 2021-22 GDP growth upwards. Experts say it will be the world\u2019s fastest growing economy next year.The demand for credit is rising. The Sensex is scaling new peaks. This is understandable as the earnings season in the festive quarter of October-December looks good. Havells India saw its net profits and revenue rise 75% and 40% respectively in the same period over the previous year. It is the same for UltraTech Cement (net profit has zoomed by 123%), Asian Paints (net profit up 62%) and Bajaj Auto (net profit growing at a historic high of 23% to Rs 1,556 crore). Companies like Maruti Suzuki and Sobha Developers have also logged record sales in the festive quarter.Leading AC and refrigerator companies are ramping up capacity by 50-100% on the back of good demand forecast, the China factor and the government\u2019s AtmaNirbhar push. An analysis by ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) of Q3 results echoes the mood. For the 238 sample companies, revenue rose by 10.4% and net profit shot up by 151%. YS Guleria, director, sales & marketing, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, says they too have focused on improving efficiencies, from production to manpower.\u201cNever waste a crisis,\u201d says Keswani of Lemon Tree Hotels, whose belt-tightening measures are yielding impressive results. Despite the pandemic challenges, his net EBITDA margin has grown to 32% in October-December. \u201cI expect robust financial growth from 2022,\u201d he says. India Inc\u2019s good results are more profit-led than wage-led growth. Flip the coin \u2014 and you see another side. It\u2019s the not-so-cheery world of minions and millions.Consider the 6.5 crore MSMEs that employ about 12 crore workers, contribute 30% to the GDP and almost half of India\u2019s exports. The world of these traders and businesspeople has been ravaged by the virus. Take the case of Firozabad-based Glass Creations that exports glass vases to the US and Europe and employs 50-odd workers.\u201cWe are ruined, barely able to survive,\u201d says owner Rajinder Gupta. Surprisingly, the problem is not his order book, he says. A surge in input costs, container shortage, difficulty in availing credit and the absence of government support for exporters have all conspired to worsen his woes in this long Covid year. \u201cWe have been abandoned. We are operating at 60% capacity. I don\u2019t know for how long this will continue,\u201d says Gupta.The world of India\u2019s 450 million-plus workers \u2014 almost 80% of them in the unorganised sector \u2014 lies shattered. In a young country with the world\u2019s second largest workforce, a pandemic-triggered lockdown and an economic recession have kicked off a wave of layoffs and income loss that have blighted lives. Ask Delhi-based house painter Murari Kumar. A school dropout, the 38-year-old daily wager was first hit by demonetisation in 2016.Now, he is reeling from Covid-triggered economic shock. Once he was busy throughout the month; today he barely gets work half the time. The lockdown has pushed him deep in debt. The father of two is slowly recovering, but financial worries are troubling him. \u201cThree months of rent are overdue. I don\u2019t know how I will pay it back,\u201d he says.In this layoff season, educated Indians are also hurting. Akshay Prasad (name changed on request), 32, an MBA, used to work with the entertainment company Vakaao. He lives with his retired parents and his wife in a 1BHK apartment in Mumbai. Soon after the lockdown, his salary was cut and in October he was laid off.\u201cWith no savings, high expenses, including an EMI of Rs 16,000, life has been very difficult,\u201d he says. The EMI is for the personal loan he took when his father fell ill. \u201cI even had to sell off gold to arrange some money,\u201d he says. After eight years in the entertainment industry, he is now looking for a job in other sectors. Joblessness is what CEOs, economists and the middle-class flag as the biggest problem of the Indian economy.This dichotomous growth is visible at multiple levels. There is the large-vs-small divide \u2014 large companies have fared a lot better than MSMEs. The economy contracted by 23.9% in the first quarter and by 7.5% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, according to RBI, profits of non-financial listed firms surged to 35% in the September quarter.Aziz of JP Morgan says, \u201cWe are the most optimistic on the street on India\u2019s growth. Despite that, India\u2019s GDP by March-end 2022 will still be 4-5% lower than India\u2019s pre-pandemic growth. This suggests an average income loss of $200 billion over two years, most of it suffered by MSMEs and households.\u201dFurther, informal and unorganised sector \u2014 where 80% of India\u2019s 450 million workers are employed \u2014 have been hit disproportionately hard. This is especially so in the services sector \u2014 from restaurants to hotels, cab drivers to carpenters.Most of them have slipped through the cracks, with very little access to government support. Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general, Federation of Indian MSMEs, says that out of the 6.5 crore MSMEs, just 25-30 lakh (mostly in manufacturing) are registered. All the talk about moratorium may mean nothing as \u201c90% of MSMEs have no access to any institutional credit and have not taken loans,\u201d he says. They need focused policy to aid their revival.There is also the urban-rural divide. In the rural economy, the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown has been less severe. Also, following the migrant crisis, the government pumped in more money into the rural economy while supporting incomes through schemes like MNREGA. \u201cRural India benefitted structurally a lot more from government schemes,\u201d says Vinayak Chatterjee of Feedback Infra. In contrast, there has been little support for the urban poor who were also hard hit, with the services economy in tatters. CEOs and economists say policy focus should tilt towards supporting the urban poor. \u201cSo far government schemes have paid attention to supply-side issues. Now it must shift focus to demand-side challenges,\u201d says Joshi.The biggest fear among experts is that India\u2019s economic recovery could be K-shaped, which would mean a further sharpening of the divide. The latest Oxfam report, \u201cThe Inequality Virus\u201d, reveals that amid the lockdown, as thousands of people went hungry and homeless, the wealth of billionaires increased by 35%. \u201cWhat is worrisome is that gains in the (current economic) growth are not distributed equally and skewed towards people with higher incomes,\u201d says Joshi.The overwhelming view that emerges from an analysis of ET Magazine\u2019s pre-budget poll as well as extensive conversations with 20-odd CEOs and economists is that the budget must focus on creating jobs and reviving MSMEs with a strong focus on the urban poor. Giving priority to labour-intensive manufacturing sector, infrastructure and construction with strong backward and forward linkages to the economy is one way to go about it. The government seems to be veering towards that.\u201cTowards the end of 2020, we saw a thrust on infrastructure sector spending,\u201d says Chatterjee. The buzz is that the government will set up a sovereign-backed development financial institution that will help fund India\u2019s massive infrastructure spend target of Rs 20 lakh crore annually for the next five years.For now, a fall in daily Covid cases, the vaccine rollout and signs of economic recovery are keeping the spirits high. \u201cBut for it to sustain, the government must change gear and focus on demand-side challenges. If they don\u2019t do that, it will be difficult to revive growth and investment,\u201d says Sinha.India\u2019s millions of workers and MSMEs may lie at the bottom of the pyramid, but they are the backbone of the economy. They deserve urgent attention in this budget.",

There is huge job and income loss,\u201d says Deep Kalra, cofounder of MakeMyTrip, about the industry that employs over 80 million people.\u201cCasualty is very high in the sector, which is dominated by small, unorganised players. We have cried ourselves hoarse but there is no response (from the government). We are disillusioned.\u201d The report card for the government varies, depending on who is grading. Economists have been the harshest critics, with just 4% assessing the government\u2019s performance as excellent, while 32% each give it good, average and bad ratings.CEOs have graded the government a tad better \u2014 8% rate it excellent, 44% good, 37% average and just 11% bad. Among the middle class, 12% give it an excellent grade, 34% good, 35% average and 19% bad. \u201cThe government has managed well in a tough year. We must give credit where it is due,\u201d says Rashesh Shah, chairman, Edelweiss Group. Agrees Patu Keswani of Lemon Tree Hotels: \u201cI am happy with the way the government has responded. Remember, this is from someone whose sector has been badly affected.\u201dInterestingly, a big chunk of all three categories of respondents \u2014 72% CEOs, 76% economists and 55% of middle-class Indians \u2014 wants the budget to boost spending and investment. And how have things been at home? Amid the pandemic, work from home (WFH) has led to longer work hours for most people and heightened loneliness for some. The crisis has also forced the majority to reset life expectations even as they tackle headwinds in their professional lives.India has been facing headwinds for quite some time. Much before Covid, experts were worrying about slowing economic growth, muted sentiments, poor investment and falling jobs. All of these worsened over the past year. \u201cEven before the pandemic, the government was fiscally stressed. After that, it didn\u2019t have much fiscal space,\u201d says Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, India Ratings.Last year, when rich countries loosened their purse strings to roll out generous stimulus programmes, India too unveiled a headline-grabbing plan of Rs 30 lakh crore across multiple trances. It outlined many measures, including AtmaNirbhar Bharat programmes and performance-linked incentives, boost for domestic manufacturing, improved credit access for enterprises, moratorium on interest payments and thrust on affordable housing and MNREGA. But in both intent and reality, it fell far short of everyone\u2019s expectations. Partly, this tight-fistedness has been attributed to the government\u2019s concerns on rising fiscal deficit.\u201cThe government has held back public expenditure,\u201d says former chief statistician and economist Pronab Sen. Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist, CRISIL India, says, \u201cAn interesting feature of India\u2019s sharp economic recovery has been that it happened without too much government support.\u201d Among the economists who took part in the ET Magazine poll, only 5% say the government handled the economy well.Jahangir Aziz, global head EM, Economic & Commodities Research, JP Morgan, says not only did the Indian government overreact with the world\u2019s most stringent lockdown but it did not follow it up with an adequate fiscal stimulus to aid economic recovery. \u201cThe question to ask is \u2014 by showing fiscal rectitude in a year when India\u2019s GDP growth rate was the worst in its recorded history, has the government impaired India\u2019s medium-term economic growth?\u201d asks Aziz.On the eve of the budget, another question to ask is what should its focus be. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings, says the government should just keep things grounded in reality. \u201cMake it a credible budget. Don\u2019t overstate income like non-tax revenue and disinvestment proceeds,\u201d he says.Economists who took part in the survey are divided on what should be the thrust of the budget: while 35% say the FM should maintain fiscal discipline, 30% urge Sitharaman to borrow more.Through the mist, a few things are becoming clearer: the disparity is becoming deeper. As Joshi of CRISIL India says, \u201cIt (the economic recovery) has been a story of two halves.\u201d On one side, green shoots are emerging. The IMF has revised India\u2019s 2021-22 GDP growth upwards. Experts say it will be the world\u2019s fastest growing economy next year.The demand for credit is rising. The Sensex is scaling new peaks. This is understandable as the earnings season in the festive quarter of October-December looks good. Havells India saw its net profits and revenue rise 75% and 40% respectively in the same period over the previous year. It is the same for UltraTech Cement (net profit has zoomed by 123%), Asian Paints (net profit up 62%) and Bajaj Auto (net profit growing at a historic high of 23% to Rs 1,556 crore). Companies like Maruti Suzuki and Sobha Developers have also logged record sales in the festive quarter.Leading AC and refrigerator companies are ramping up capacity by 50-100% on the back of good demand forecast, the China factor and the government\u2019s AtmaNirbhar push. An analysis by ET Intelligence Group (ETIG) of Q3 results echoes the mood. For the 238 sample companies, revenue rose by 10.4% and net profit shot up by 151%. YS Guleria, director, sales & marketing, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, says they too have focused on improving efficiencies, from production to manpower.\u201cNever waste a crisis,\u201d says Keswani of Lemon Tree Hotels, whose belt-tightening measures are yielding impressive results. Despite the pandemic challenges, his net EBITDA margin has grown to 32% in October-December. \u201cI expect robust financial growth from 2022,\u201d he says. India Inc\u2019s good results are more profit-led than wage-led growth. Flip the coin \u2014 and you see another side. It\u2019s the not-so-cheery world of minions and millions.Consider the 6.5 crore MSMEs that employ about 12 crore workers, contribute 30% to the GDP and almost half of India\u2019s exports. The world of these traders and businesspeople has been ravaged by the virus. Take the case of Firozabad-based Glass Creations that exports glass vases to the US and Europe and employs 50-odd workers.\u201cWe are ruined, barely able to survive,\u201d says owner Rajinder Gupta. Surprisingly, the problem is not his order book, he says. A surge in input costs, container shortage, difficulty in availing credit and the absence of government support for exporters have all conspired to worsen his woes in this long Covid year. \u201cWe have been abandoned. We are operating at 60% capacity. I don\u2019t know for how long this will continue,\u201d says Gupta.The world of India\u2019s 450 million-plus workers \u2014 almost 80% of them in the unorganised sector \u2014 lies shattered. In a young country with the world\u2019s second largest workforce, a pandemic-triggered lockdown and an economic recession have kicked off a wave of layoffs and income loss that have blighted lives. Ask Delhi-based house painter Murari Kumar. A school dropout, the 38-year-old daily wager was first hit by demonetisation in 2016.Now, he is reeling from Covid-triggered economic shock. Once he was busy throughout the month; today he barely gets work half the time. The lockdown has pushed him deep in debt. The father of two is slowly recovering, but financial worries are troubling him. \u201cThree months of rent are overdue. I don\u2019t know how I will pay it back,\u201d he says.In this layoff season, educated Indians are also hurting. Akshay Prasad (name changed on request), 32, an MBA, used to work with the entertainment company Vakaao. He lives with his retired parents and his wife in a 1BHK apartment in Mumbai. Soon after the lockdown, his salary was cut and in October he was laid off.\u201cWith no savings, high expenses, including an EMI of Rs 16,000, life has been very difficult,\u201d he says. The EMI is for the personal loan he took when his father fell ill. \u201cI even had to sell off gold to arrange some money,\u201d he says. After eight years in the entertainment industry, he is now looking for a job in other sectors. Joblessness is what CEOs, economists and the middle-class flag as the biggest problem of the Indian economy.This dichotomous growth is visible at multiple levels. There is the large-vs-small divide \u2014 large companies have fared a lot better than MSMEs. The economy contracted by 23.9% in the first quarter and by 7.5% in the second quarter. Meanwhile, according to RBI, profits of non-financial listed firms surged to 35% in the September quarter.Aziz of JP Morgan says, \u201cWe are the most optimistic on the street on India\u2019s growth. Despite that, India\u2019s GDP by March-end 2022 will still be 4-5% lower than India\u2019s pre-pandemic growth. This suggests an average income loss of $200 billion over two years, most of it suffered by MSMEs and households.\u201dFurther, informal and unorganised sector \u2014 where 80% of India\u2019s 450 million workers are employed \u2014 have been hit disproportionately hard. This is especially so in the services sector \u2014 from restaurants to hotels, cab drivers to carpenters.Most of them have slipped through the cracks, with very little access to government support. Anil Bhardwaj, secretary general, Federation of Indian MSMEs, says that out of the 6.5 crore MSMEs, just 25-30 lakh (mostly in manufacturing) are registered. All the talk about moratorium may mean nothing as \u201c90% of MSMEs have no access to any institutional credit and have not taken loans,\u201d he says. They need focused policy to aid their revival.There is also the urban-rural divide. In the rural economy, the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown has been less severe. Also, following the migrant crisis, the government pumped in more money into the rural economy while supporting incomes through schemes like MNREGA. \u201cRural India benefitted structurally a lot more from government schemes,\u201d says Vinayak Chatterjee of Feedback Infra. In contrast, there has been little support for the urban poor who were also hard hit, with the services economy in tatters. CEOs and economists say policy focus should tilt towards supporting the urban poor. \u201cSo far government schemes have paid attention to supply-side issues. Now it must shift focus to demand-side challenges,\u201d says Joshi.The biggest fear among experts is that India\u2019s economic recovery could be K-shaped, which would mean a further sharpening of the divide. The latest Oxfam report, \u201cThe Inequality Virus\u201d, reveals that amid the lockdown, as thousands of people went hungry and homeless, the wealth of billionaires increased by 35%. \u201cWhat is worrisome is that gains in the (current economic) growth are not distributed equally and skewed towards people with higher incomes,\u201d says Joshi.The overwhelming view that emerges from an analysis of ET Magazine\u2019s pre-budget poll as well as extensive conversations with 20-odd CEOs and economists is that the budget must focus on creating jobs and reviving MSMEs with a strong focus on the urban poor. Giving priority to labour-intensive manufacturing sector, infrastructure and construction with strong backward and forward linkages to the economy is one way to go about it. The government seems to be veering towards that.\u201cTowards the end of 2020, we saw a thrust on infrastructure sector spending,\u201d says Chatterjee. The buzz is that the government will set up a sovereign-backed development financial institution that will help fund India\u2019s massive infrastructure spend target of Rs 20 lakh crore annually for the next five years.For now, a fall in daily Covid cases, the vaccine rollout and signs of economic recovery are keeping the spirits high. \u201cBut for it to sustain, the government must change gear and focus on demand-side challenges. If they don\u2019t do that, it will be difficult to revive growth and investment,\u201d says Sinha.India\u2019s millions of workers and MSMEs may lie at the bottom of the pyramid, but they are the backbone of the economy. They deserve urgent attention in this budget.",
    "deficit_score": 2,
    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights several factors that suggest a potential increase in future fiscal deficit. Firstly, there is a strong call from CEOs, economists, and middle-class Indians for increased government spending and investment to address job losses and economic recovery. This implies higher government expenditure, which could widen the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the government's previous fiscal restraint, driven by concerns over rising fiscal deficit, has been criticized for not providing adequate stimulus during the pandemic. The article also mentions the government's plans for significant infrastructure spending, which, while beneficial for long-term growth, could further strain the fiscal deficit in the short term. Furthermore, the economic recovery has been uneven, with MSMEs and the informal sector disproportionately affected, suggesting that targeted government support may be necessary, adding to fiscal pressures. Overall, the article suggests that future fiscal policy may involve increased spending to address economic challenges, which could lead to a higher fiscal deficit.",

Although this double jeopardy still has some distance to go before stabilising, given India\u2019s vital relations with the eight Gulf countries, the situation\u2019s impact on bilateral economic ties needs to be anticipated and managed.\n\nOil prices in a tailspin\n\nThe region, especially Iran, has been mauled by COVID-19, and the figures are yet to peak. The pandemic has put nearly a third of the world\u2019s population under some form of lockdown curbing the consumption of hydrocarbons, the mainstay of Gulf economies. A Goldman Sachs report published on March 30 estimated that COVID-19 had lowered the world crude consumption by 28 million bpd. The consequent oil glut began depressing the price. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other crude producers (OPEC+), however, failed to reach a production-curtailing strategy as Saudi Arabia and Russia, the cartel\u2019s two biggest producers, held different views. As a result, OPEC+ unravelled with each producer chasing a higher share in a collapsing market. Consequently, the oil prices went for a tailspin having fallen by 55% during March to an 18-year low on March 30. Though the market has recovered since and a wider production-sharing compromise is in the works, the general outlook remains bleak.\n\nIn a rare joint statement on March 16, the heads of OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that developing countries\u2019 oil and gas revenues will decline by 50% to 85% in 2020 with potentially far-reaching economic and social consequences. The economic outlook for the Gulf has indeed deteriorated, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal deficit expected to cross 8% in 2020. The global economy is expected to have a recession induced by COVID-19 this year. Even if it limps back to growth in 2021, the process may be slow and less energy-intensive: national self-reliance on strategic goods such as pharmaceuticals may deter their trade, and the tourism and hospitality sectors, the core of Dubai\u2019s economy, may take much longer to resuscitate. The pandemic has already made this year\u2019s Hajj and Dubai Expo doubtful.\n\nIndia\u2019s economic ties with the Gulf states have two dominant verticals: the economic symbiosis and India\u2019s expatriate community. Bilateral economic ties are strong: the India-Gulf trade stood around $162 billion in 2018-19, being nearly a fifth of India\u2019s global trade. It was dominated by import of crude oil and natural gas worth nearly $75 billion, meeting nearly 65% of India\u2019s total requirements. Some of these countries have large Indian investments and some have planned large investments in India. Second, the number of Indian expatriates in the Gulf states is about nine million, and they remitted nearly $40 billion back home. Both these intertwined pillars of India-Gulf ties have been affected by the recent maelstrom roiling the shared region.\n\nIndia being the world\u2019s third largest importer of crude, a sharp and prolonged decline in oil prices helps its current account. However, this is not an unmitigated blessing. The Gulf\u2019s lower oil revenues also presage decreased bilateral trade and investments as well as expatriates\u2019 remittances \u2014 all of them adding to India\u2019s current financial stress.\n\nImpact on expatriates\n\nOil is a cyclic commodity and the Gulf producers have long evolved a pattern to handle its periodic lows. They tend to tighten their belts and dip into their reserves. They also transfer the burden on to the last person in line, viz. the Asian expatriate. The fresh recruitment stops, salaries are either lowered or stalled, taxes raised and localisation drives launched. The net result is that a large number of expatriates return to their homes. This time there is an added complication of the pandemic, to which the Asian expatriates living in densely populated camps are particularly vulnerable. In case the pandemic worsens in the lower Gulf, panic-stricken, wage-deprived Indians may prefer to come back. This would create an exodus of epic proportions, the nearest example being the evacuation of over 1,50,000 Indians from Kuwait in 1990-91, albeit for political reasons, an event that upended India\u2019s economy. Apart from creating a logistical nightmare of transporting millions of expatriates back, they would need to be resettled and re-employed.\n\nWhile hoping that the Gulf states are able to contain the pandemic and the oil shock, India needs to make some contingency plans in consultation with the individual countries. It should do whatever it takes to enhance their capacity to handle COVID-19 cases among the Indian expatriates. India\u2019s missions there also need to monitor the situation and try to avoid panic among its nationals.\n\nIn the longer run, it is quite clear that we need to find new drivers for the India-Gulf synergy. This search could begin with cooperation in healthcare and gradually extend outward towards pharmaceutical research and production, petrochemical complexes, building infrastructure in India and in third countries, agriculture, education and skilling as well as the economic activities in bilateral free zones created along our Arabian Sea coast eventually leading to an India-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Area. Only then would we have sufficiently diversified the India-Gulf economic ties to protect them from such shocks.\n\nMahesh Sachdev, a former Ambassador, is President, Eco-Diplomacy & Strategies,\n\nNew Delhi",

For, the decisions of the central bank are seldom made in isolation, in silo; they are part of a broader holistic framework, banking is India in microcosm. Let us hit the high spots for a comprehensive assessment and perspective.The global economy is characterized by imminent uncertainty. It has been hit by geopolitical fractures, economic fragmentation, financial turbulence, significant central bank interest rate hikes to restore price stability, and a withdrawal of fiscal support amidst higher debt-to-GDP ratios and unsustainable debt dynamics. The US economy\u2019s performance has been solid, with the real gross domestic product (GDP) increasing by 2.8 % in Q3 of 2024 compared to a 3.0 % increase in Q2 of 2024. The increase in the Q 3 largely stemmed from increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and business investment. Imports also rose.Interest rates in the United States at 20-year highs fell steadily from their peak in 2022, inducing the Fed to reduce its key rate by a half-point in September and a quarter-point in November. The Fed indicated in September that it expected to announce another quarter-point cut later this month. Yet inflation continues to exceed the Fed\u2019s target level, making things uneasy. In October, \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 2.8% year-on-year, up from 2.7% in September. The dollar has appreciated sharply against other world currencies.To be sure, there is no imminent threat of a systemic debt crisis but the susceptibility of low and middle-income countries to high debt servicing costs may be tested. Despite these and other concerns of considerable contemporary significance, the global economy has been resilient at 3.2 % during 2023 and 2024 and 3.3 % in 2025. With the global economy defying fears of stagflation or recession, there are reasons for concern but not for alarm in the disruptive scenario of today\u2019s VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world characterized by the growth of technology, increasing globalization with rising protectionism, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Middle Eastern situation, and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats.India has successfully transitioned from a part of the \u2018Fragile Five\u2019 a decade ago to a \u2018bright spot\u2019 in the global economy. With decelerating growth, low investor confidence, a dozen Indian billionaires going bust, and unsustainably high and mounting defaults and delinquencies, the Indian economy was on the edge of the precipice. Things have turned around now and there is an upswing in the Indian economy. India has been the fastest-growing major economy for the third successive year. India contributed 16 % to the global growth in 2023. India\u2019s growth rate of 7.2 % in FY 23 was the second-highest among the G20 countries and almost twice the average for emerging market economies (EMEs) that year.A digital revolution, a renewed capex cycle, a well-capitalized banking system, robust credit growth, an upturn in the housing sector, rising domestic consumption, robust investment, growing services exports, and \u201cdigitalization-driven productivity gains\u201d are force multipliers. India would consolidate its global heft through important transformative drivers on demand (consumer boom, ascendant middle class, and green transition) and supply (demographic dividend, greater access to finance, and streamlined infrastructure - both physical and digital). Thus the remarkable Indian odyssey is well on course to achieve its rightful place in the comity of nations.With no possibility of recession, reflecting macroeconomic resilience and dynamism, India is at a crossroads. At this defining moment, India has to simultaneously focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability and carrying forward structural reforms meaningfully and effectively. This process has strengthened India\u2019s economic resilience despite global headwinds and structural obstacles. But there are persisting challenges to enhance the share of manufacturing in India\u2019s GDP vis-a-vis average in low and middle-income countries; adequately capitalize on the inherent labor and skill cost advantages to develop large-scale labor-intensive manufacturing; simplify complex land and labor laws; provide productive employment and to absorb out-migration of labor from agriculture; strong macroeconomic fundamentals including low and stable rates of inflation and a falling fiscal deficit. Structural reforms must drive economic reforms, and inclusive growth and address health, education, and employment concerns.Sustained demographic dividend, services export opportunities, domestic demand potential, increasingly assertive middle class, and India\u2019s emergence as an attractive investment destination provide tailwinds for the Indian economy. Strengthened physical sector, viz., highways length, reduced peak energy deficit, improved logistics efficiency, a renewed thrust on exports and investments strengthen macroeconomic growth.Leading development indicators include robust tax collections; higher corporate bond issuance suggesting business recovery; capital market levels; core sector output; and forex reserves. Hence, India could grow sustainably by 7-8 % over the long haul.Against this canvas, India\u2019s GDP grew at a seven-quarter low of 5.4 % in July-September, 2024 (lower than 8.1 % growth in July-September, 2023 and 6.7 % in April-June, 2024) and caused some skepticism about the realizability of the RBI\u2019s upward revision of growth estimates to 7.2 % to 7.2 % in June from 7 % in April for FY 25.This deceleration occurred largely because of infirm manufacturing (deceleration to 2.2% growth year-on-year in July-September versus 7% growth in April-June), electricity and gas production, and contraction in mining. Weak urban consumption following a rise in food prices despite rising government spending and a \u201cshrinking\u201d middle segment causes concern. There were also factors like dropping company profits, falling wages, and inflation.While this GDP growth is below the expectation of about 6.5 % growth in Q2, it is a temporary blip because of the forthcoming impact of healthy kharif sowing, good prospects for rabi crops, restored reservoir levels, rising government expenditure, and the festive season upswing. There could also be a recovery in rural demand because of robust agricultural performance and surging government spending. Hence, this is not a structural retrogression of any kind. Hence, there is no reason for alarm and India is well on course to achieve a GDP growth of over 6.5 % in FY 25. India remains among the fastest-growing major economies. Decelerating GDP growth would, however, make the RBI\u2019s task of adroitly managing the growth-inflation trade-off odious.While the RBI Act mandates price stability in terms of headline inflation i.e., 4 % +/- 2 %, food inflation is not largely amenable to the RBI measures.

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article provides a mixed outlook on India's fiscal deficit but leans slightly toward a negative direction. While it highlights India's strong macroeconomic fundamentals, including robust tax collections, rising government expenditure, and a falling fiscal deficit, it also emphasizes challenges such as decelerating GDP growth, weak urban consumption, and rising food prices. The mention of \"rising government expenditure\" and \"surging government spending\" suggests potential pressure on the fiscal deficit, especially if revenue growth does not keep pace. Additionally, the article notes that the RBI\u2019s growth projections for FY25 might be revised downward, which could further strain fiscal balances. Although there is no explicit prediction of a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, the combination of higher spending and slower growth hints at a potential upward pressure on the deficit in the future.  \n\n**",

Seeking to address farm distress ahead of general elections, the government has hiked Minimum Support Price (MSP) paid to farmers for paddy by a record Rs 200 per quintal and by up to 52 percent in other Kharif or summer-sown crops. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Announcing the decision after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), Home Minister Rajnath Singh said it would cost an additional Rs 15,000 crore to the exchequer. In the 2018-19 Budget, the government has provided Rs 1.7 lakh crore towards food subsidy. \"Considering the large provisioning made in the Budget for food subsidy, the government will be able to absorb the additional expenditure without breaching the fiscal deficit target,\" Jaitley said in a tweet. Jaitley had presented the Budget as Finance Minister and is now a minister without portfolio as he is recuperating from a kidney transplant operation. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit for the current financial year ending March 2019 to 3.3 percent of the GDP from 3.5 percent in the previous fiscal.

According to a senior agriculture ministry official, the increase in MSP of paddy would result in an additional burden of Rs 12,000 crore to the exchequer as the government procures paddy from farmers for supply through ration shops.

This severe economic downturn, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, has led to a massive slump in key sectors like manufacturing, construction, and trade. Government expenditure also contracted by 10.3%, indicating reduced fiscal activity. While the article does not explicitly discuss future fiscal deficit projections, the economic contraction and reduced government spending suggest potential challenges in tax revenue collection and increased pressure on public finances. The Reserve Bank of India's prediction of negative GDP growth for the year further implies a strained fiscal environment. Given these factors, it is reasonable to infer that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase in the future due to lower revenue and potential stimulus measures to revive the economy.",

This indicates a positive impact on the fiscal deficit in the near term.

Additionally, Fitch Ratings notes that the volatility of RBI transfers introduces uncertainty about their medium-term sustainability, implying that the positive impact on the fiscal deficit may not be long-lasting. The government has set a target of reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY26, which suggests a commitment to deficit reduction, but the article does not provide strong evidence of significant or sustained fiscal improvement beyond the immediate impact of the RBI dividend.

It was required to submit the report by October 30, 2019 for five years for the period 2020-21 to 2024-25. However, due to various political and fiscal developments, notifications were issued first, on July 27 extending the tenure of the Commission up to November 30, 2019, and again on November 29 requiring it to submit two reports, one for 2020-21 and the second covering the period of five years beginning April 1, 2021 and further extending the tenure up to October 30, 2021. The first report submitted by the Commission was placed in Parliament by the Union Finance Minister before presenting the Union Budget on February 1, 2019.\n\nBasis for extension\n\nThere were good reasons for extending the tenure of the Finance Commission as making medium-term projections in the current scenario would have entailed serious risks. First, the abolition of Statehood to Jammu and Kashmir required the Commission to make an estimation excluding the Union Territory. Second, the deceleration in growth and low inflation has substantially slowed down the nominal GDP growth which is the main tax base proxy; making projections of tax revenues and expenditures based on this for the medium term could have posed serious risks. Finally, poor revenue performance of tax collection and more particularly Goods and Services Tax combined with the fact that the compensation agreement to the loss of revenue to the States was effective only two years of the period covered by the Commission\u2019s recommendations posed uncertainties.\n\nOn projections\n\nThe Commission has continued with the approach and methodology adopted by the previous Commissions for tax devolution and revenue-gap grants. It has made projections of revenues and revenue expenditures of the Union and individual States, applied selective norms to the latter, recommended devolution of taxes to the States from the divisible pool, and recommended revenue deficit grants for the States which had post-devolution gaps. Although there were apprehensions that it may deviate from past practice as the terms of reference of the Commission had indicated, \u201cThe Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all\u201d, it continued with the past practice.\n\nBy stating that, \u201c\u2026stability and predictability of resources is an essential component of good long-term budgeting for both Union and States\u201d, the Fifteenth Finance Commission continued with the recommendation of the previous Commission relating to vertical division of taxes, and adjusted the States\u2019 share to 41% to exclude the share of Jammu and Kashmir. There were media reports that the share would be reduced and by maintaining the share, the Commission has avoided controversy.\n\nHowever, for the period 2021-25, it has stated: \u201cOur recommendation in the final report would undergo changes and adjustments as appropriate, in the light of subsequent data and analysis\u201d. For the horizontal shares, however, the formula has been changed to consider \u201cfiscal needs, equity and efficiency\u201d.\n\nAddressing States\u2019 concerns\n\nIn addition to income distance, population and area and forest cover, it has used two additional factors \u2014 demographic performance and tax effort. It has assigned 15% weight to the 2011 population, reduced the weight of income distance to 45%, increased the weight to forest cover and ecology to 10% and 12.5% weight to demographic performance and 2.5% weight to tax effort. There was considerable controversy over the terms of reference of the Commission requiring it to use 2011 population in its formula by the States that had taken initiatives to arrest population growth.\n\nBy keeping the weight of 2011 population at 15% and giving an additional 12.5% to demographic performance which is the inverse of fertility rate, the Commission has shown sensitivity to the concerns of these States.\n\nIn terms of relative shares in tax devolution, among the major States the biggest loser is Karnataka followed by Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have post-devolution gaps and hence qualify for revenue gap grants. The major reason for Karnataka and Kerala losing on devolution is that their per capita income growth has been faster than most other States. The difference from the highest per capita income in both Karnataka and Kerala is just about 10% now as compared to 34% and 23%, respectively, for the two States when the Fourteenth Finance Commission made the recommendation. In the case of Karnataka and Telangana, as the projected transfer (devolution and revenue-gap grants) in 2020-21 were lower than 2019-20, the Commission recommended a special grant of \u20b95,495 crore and \u20b9723 crore, respectively. However, the government has not accepted the recommendation and has asked the Commission to reconsider it.\n\nLocal body grants\n\nThe recommended grants for local bodies amount to \u20b990,000 crore comprising \u20b960,750 crore for panchayats and the remaining \u20b929,250 crore for municipal bodies. All the three layers of panchayats will receive the grant and 50% of the grant is tied to improving sanitation and supply of drinking water; the remaining is untied. In the case of municipal bodies, \u20b99,229 crore is allocated to cities with a million-plus population and the remaining \u20b920,021 is allocated to other towns. In the case of disaster relief, the Commission has recommended the creation of disaster mitigation fund at the Central and State levels. For disaster management, a total of \u20b928,183 crore has been determined of which the Central contribution will be \u20b922,184 crore. Inter-State allocation is made based on past expenditures, area and population and disaster risk index.\n\nThe Commission has worked out a framework for giving some sectoral grants as well. For 2020-21, it has recommended \u20b97,735 crore for improving nutrition based on the numbers of children in the 0-6 age group and lactating mothers. In the main report, it has proposed to give grants for police training, modernisation and housing, railway projects in States taken on a cost-sharing basis, maintenance of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana roads, strengthening the judicial system, and improving the statistical system. The States are required to prepare the necessary grounds. It has also presented a broad framework for recommending monitorable performance grants for agricultural reform, development of aspirational districts and blocks, power sector reform, and incentives to enhance trade including exports and pre-primary education. The challenge, however, will be to design and dovetail sectoral and performance grants with the existing plethora of central sector and centrally sponsored schemes.\n\nM.

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article highlights accounting irregularities by the Central government of India, specifically the misclassification of \u20b910,250 crore of cess receipts as non-tax revenue to artificially inflate revenue receipts and understate the fiscal deficit for 2018-19. While the focus is on past actions, the implications for the future fiscal deficit are concerning. The CAG\u2019s findings suggest a potential lack of fiscal discipline and transparency in government accounting practices. If such practices continue or are uncovered further, it could lead to increased scrutiny, stricter enforcement of accounting norms, and potential adjustments to future deficit calculations. Additionally, the misallocation of funds designated for specific purposes (e.g., infrastructure) could undermine public trust and necessitate corrective measures, potentially increasing future deficits. While the article does not explicitly predict future deficits, the underlying issues suggest a risk of fiscal mismanagement, which could lead to higher deficits in the future.  \n\n**",

Key indicators include:  \n1. **Revenue Shortfalls:** Tax collections (both direct and GST) and disinvestment revenues are underperforming, making it unlikely that revenue targets will be met.  \n2. **Growth Slowdown:** Economic growth is slowing, which further reduces revenue generation and increases fiscal stress.  \n3. **Spending Push:** Analysts and economists advocate for increased government spending to stimulate growth, which would widen the deficit.  \n4. **Relaxation of Deficit Targets:** There is a consensus among experts that the fiscal deficit target should be relaxed to accommodate higher spending, indicating a deliberate move toward a larger deficit.  \n5. **Breach of Deficit Target:** The article explicitly mentions that the fiscal deficit is likely to breach the target of 3.3% of GDP, with further relaxation expected in the medium term.  \n\nThese factors collectively",

The gauge rose 0.5 percent at 9:47 a.m. in Mumbai, as Asian stocks rebounded from their worst week since 2011.In comparison, flows to debt funds dwindled to 165 billion rupees from 1.65 trillion rupees, the data show, as sentiment soured on bonds amid elevated oil prices and hardening global yields. Inflows will gather pace as equity markets remain on unsteady footing and the tax on stocks damps their allure, according to SBI Funds Management Pvt.\u201cRetail flows to fixed-income funds will go up simply because the relative differential in returns between debt and equity will narrow\u201d because of the tax on stocks, said Navneet Munot , who oversees about $32 billion in assets at SBI Funds. \u201cAlso, with rates likely to go up from here, debt products are going to be more attractive.\u201dAxis Asset Management Co., which oversees $11.4 billion, sees value in the short-end of the yield curve, said R. Sivakumar, head of fixed income in Mumbai. He recommends short- and medium-term funds, and suggests liquid and ultra-short plans for a shorter holding period.Still, demand for debt won\u2019t come entirely at the cost of equity inflows, Principal PNB\u2019s Jain said. An improving global economic outlook and a recovery in Indian corporate earnings will support investor optimism, he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t think investors will swing entirely into debt as equities is still a good asset class to be invested in,\u201d Jain said. \u201cInvestors must have balanced allocation. More so now.\u201d",

It does not explicitly address government spending plans, tax revenue projections, or fiscal policy changes that would directly influence the future fiscal deficit. While there is mention of the central bank's neutral stance and potential rate increases, these are more relevant to monetary policy than fiscal policy. The article does not provide any clear indication of future fiscal deficit direction, such as increased government spending or changes in revenue collection. Therefore, based on the lack of explicit fiscal deficit-related information, the article is neutral regarding the future fiscal deficit.",

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has warned that these measures, along with past fiscal mismanagement (e.g., Uday bonds for the power sector), will strain state finances. Additionally, the article mentions that while the fiscal deficit of states is budgeted to be lower in 2019-20, revised estimates and actuals often deviate significantly, indicating poor fiscal management. The discussion of rising outstanding debt as a percentage of GDP further underscores fiscal challenges. The article also notes the potential for increased fiscal pressures if income support schemes, such as the one promised by the Congress party, are implemented. Overall, the article suggests that future fiscal deficits are likely to increase due to populist spending measures and poor fiscal discipline.",

On one hand, the government has increased capital expenditure by 35%, which could lead to higher spending and potentially widen the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the fiscal deficit for 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 is already at elevated levels (6.9% and 6.4% respectively), and the government has chosen to prioritize growth over aggressive fiscal consolidation. This indicates a willingness to tolerate higher deficits in the short term. On the other hand, there are positive factors such as buoyant tax collections, which could surpass revenue assumptions and aid fiscal consolidation. The disinvestment target of \u20b965,000 crore, though conservative, could also contribute to reducing the deficit. However, the overall emphasis on growth-oriented spending and the lack of aggressive fiscal consolidation measures suggest that the fiscal deficit may remain elevated or increase slightly in the near future.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights significant concerns about the state's fiscal management, particularly its heavy reliance on central allocations and borrowings to meet expenses. The opposition leader criticizes the government for not making serious efforts to mobilize resources, which suggests a lack of proactive measures to improve fiscal health. The mention of \"relentless borrowings\" and exceeding the fiscal deficit above three per cent of the GSDP indicates a continuation of unsustainable fiscal practices. Given the absence of any plans for resource mobilization and the reliance on borrowings, it is likely that the fiscal deficit will either remain high or increase in the future. This points to a negative outlook for future fiscal deficit direction.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article highlights the potential for rising crude oil prices due to escalating tensions in West Asia, which could significantly impact India\u2019s fiscal deficit. India\u2019s heavy reliance on oil imports (87.4% in FY23) makes it vulnerable to global oil price shocks. If crude oil prices breach $100 per barrel, as feared, India\u2019s import bill will surge, widening the trade deficit and putting pressure on the exchequer. This would also lead to higher inflation, increased dollar demand, and a weaker rupee, further straining fiscal health. Additionally, the government may face higher subsidies or reduced margins for state-owned oil marketing companies, especially during the election period, which could increase fiscal spending. While the article does not explicitly predict the fiscal deficit, the implications of rising oil prices and their cascading effects suggest a likely increase in the fiscal deficit in the near future.  \n\n**",

However, the Budget FY20 may need to revise downwards the revenue estimates of the Interim Budget because of a substantial shortfall in the Centre\u2019s tax revenues in FY19. According to the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) figures, direct taxes fell short by Rs 74,774 crore and indirect taxes by Rs 93,198 crore, when compared to their revised estimates. Together, the shortfall in the central government\u2019s net tax revenues amounted to 0.9% of GDP. Meeting the Interim Budget tax revenue targets would call for a growth of nearly 29% in the Centre\u2019s net taxes, implying a buoyancy of 2.8, which is much higher than what has been achieved in the recent years.\n\nAt the same time, there is a well-recognised need to stimulate the economy because of the trend of falling growth. The real GDP growth has steadily fallen on a quarterly basis from a peak of 8% in 1QFY19 to 5.8% in 4QFY19. Consequently, the annual growth in FY19 fell to 6.8% from its peak of 8.2% in FY17. With India\u2019s net exports contributing negatively to GDP growth in recent years, most of Indian growth will have to depend on domestic factors. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in its June 6, 2019, monetary policy review, has projected GDP growth at 7% for 2019-20, lowering its earlier forecast of 7.2%. It is imperative to provide a push to demand and thereby growth from the fiscal side. This could supplement the monetary-side stimulus provided by RBI through three consecutive cuts in the repo rate of 25 bps each during this calendar year. However, in order to increase credit, banks may need to increase the transmission rate, which has so far been only fractional.\n\nIt is, however, difficult to stretch fiscal deficit much more beyond the Interim Budget target of 3.4% of GDP. The profile of balance between savings and investible resources in the economy indicates that the government sector has been pre-empting almost all of the available investible resources in the form of (a) household sector financial savings, amounting to about 7% of GDP, and (b) net foreign capital inflow at about 2.5% of GDP. Considering central and state governments together, the government sector is already accessing close to 7% of GDP of these investible resources in the form of their combined borrowing. The balance of about 3% is being accessed by the central and state-level public sector entities. Had there been a strong investment demand by the private corporate sector, interest rates would have come under pressure. There is a need to adhere closely to the fiscal consolidation path as spelt out by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA).\n\nThere may be two channels that the government may rely on for financing the additional expenditure on its commitments as well as for stimulating the economy. First is non-tax revenues, particularly if some tangible additional dividends could be accessed, following the recommendations of the Bimal Jalan Committee. The second is to rely on extra-budgetary borrowings. However, it must be recognised that extra-budgetary borrowings are part of the overall public sector borrowings and cannot be stretched much beyond the current levels.

First, the government has committed to ambitious expenditure programs (e.g., Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Bharatmala, Sagarmala, etc.), which will require significant fiscal resources. Second, there is a substantial shortfall in tax revenues for FY19, and meeting the Interim Budget tax revenue targets would require an unrealistic 29% growth in net taxes, which is unlikely given recent trends. Third, the article highlights the need for fiscal stimulus to address falling GDP growth, which could further strain the budget. While the government aims to adhere to the fiscal deficit target of 3.4% of GDP, the combination of increased spending commitments, revenue shortfalls, and economic stimulus needs suggests a risk of exceeding this target.

The proposal to bring agricultural income under the purview of personal income tax, particularly above a certain threshold, aims to widen the tax base and reduce tax evasion. This could potentially increase tax revenues, which would positively impact the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the NITI Aayog\u2019s explicit proposal to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by 2018-19 and the revenue deficit to 0.9% of GDP by 2019-20 indicates a clear intention to improve fiscal discipline. However, the article does not provide detailed projections or guarantees about the success of these measures, and there is no mention of significant cuts in government spending or other fiscal tightening measures. While the direction suggested is positive, the lack of concrete details or assurances tempers the optimism.  \n\n**",

In the last 15 years, Sensex have grown at 13 per cent compounded annually compared with the nominal GDP growth of 12 per cent.\u201cEven in the last 10 years, Sensex has grown at 12 per cent compared with the 10 per cent nominal GDP growth \u2013 in this case returns were more back-ended,\" Agarwal told ETMarkets.com.Markets are always forward-looking. Agarwal said the global economy is showing clear signs of recovery. The second wave of Covid-19 is ebbing in India with total active cases at less than 20 per cent of May highs.Besides, Nifty50 companies reported a weighted average growth rate of 65 per cent in the March quarter.\"Despite coming off a low base, the growth numbers are strong and point towards recovery. The consensus estimates have pegged FY22 Nifty50 earnings growth at 35 per cent. Even factoring in some downgrades due to the second wave, we are in for a strong growth year in terms of earnings,\" he said.What also helped the market perform is the fact that organised players, mostly listed, are gaining market share from unorganised players -- strong companies are getting stronger at the expense of weaker companies.\"The listed equity space has most of the stronger organised players, while broader economic numbers are bound to include the weaker entities too. This was visible in FY21, where despite over 7 per cent contraction in the economy, Nifty50 earnings grew in double digits,\" Agarwal said.He said the consensus estimates for real GDP growth for FY22 is around 9-10 per cent, which translates into 14-15 per cent nominal GDP growth. \"While the near term is always difficult to estimate, but from medium term point of view, we maintain a positive stance towards equities.\u201dAgarwal manages PGIM India Large Cap fund, PGIM India Hybrid Equity fund and PGIM India Equity Savings fund, among others.Agarwal said while the comparison with previous peaks is quite understandable, the situation this time around is different from the Global Financial Crisis.\u201cFrom 2002 to 2007, Nifty50 was already reporting strong earnings growth of over 25 per cent. However, in the last 5 years, Nifty earnings have grown at very low single digits. With domestic and global economic recovery, the earnings growth visibility has improved significantly. The corporate profit-to-GDP ratio currently is under 3 per cent compared to 7 per cent level at the GFC peak. The recovery got interrupted by the pandemic, but looks like resuming on that path again,\" Agarwal said.The interest rates cycle also differs. From 2005 to 2008, RBI had raised repo rates by about 300 basis points, with repo at that time being at about 7-year highs.In the last 2-3 years, RBI has cut repo rates by 250 basis points, with repo now at all-time lows.Agarwal said a lot has been said and written about valuations and that even as there is no denying that equity valuation is significantly higher than the historical average. But the same thing can be viewed differently.\"As per consensus estimates, Nifty50's one-year forward P/E ratio at 21 times translates into an earnings yield of 4.8 per cent. This compares with the one-year G-Sec yield of 3.9 per cent. From the vantage point of relative asset valuation, equity does not appear more expensive than alternatives. My advice to investors would be that these are not the times to be either too conservative or too aggressive. The risk-reward metric calls for a more balanced approach in current times,\" he said.Agarwal said the recent rise in inflation has been due to a spike in agriculture, metals and oil prices.The direct impact of global metal price inflation is visible in the WPI inflation. With a 64 per cent weightage on manufactured products, WPI inflation jumped to 11-year high of 10.5 epr cent year-on-year in April. But CPI inflation, which the RBI tracks, captures less imported inflation than WPI inflation.CPI inflation is weighted towards food items (around 39 per cent weight with not much of imported inflation) and services that have a weightage of around 22 per cent in the inflation index.\"Hence, the direct impact of global metal prices is quite minimal. In fact, all possible metal items would add up to around 3-4 per cent (excluding precious metals) in CPI. The IMD expects a normal monsoon for the third straight year \u2013 last seen over 2 decades ago. A good, well-distributed and timely monsoon will mean another year of bumper farm production in 2021, which could have a cascading positive impact,\" Agarwal said.Agarwal said RBI's own inflation expectation of 5 per cent in each of the quarters in this financial year is well within its comfort zone.RBI has been supportive of growth, offering monetary stimulus in terms of rate cuts, bond-buying programs, easing norms for provisioning and so on. The government has also been providing fiscal stimulus, which pushed fiscal deficit to 9.3 per cent of GDP last year compared with the initial budgeted figure of 3.5 per cent.Agarwal said the government finances are expected to be weaker due to the economic slowdown in 1HFY22. That said, tax collections in FY21 were 7 per cent higher than budgeted - implying that required tax growth for FY22 at 9.5 per cent YoY, much lower than nominal GDP growth.\"An important discretionary source of revenues of over Rs 3 lakh crore via auto fuel duties have not seen any cuts so far, which further establish fiscal credentials. The limited welfare funding announced so far for the second wave is manageable, and considering the over-provision of subsidies in FY21, there is some headroom available for fiscal stimulus,\" Agarwal said.With Nifty50 up two times and BSE 250 Smallcap index up three times of March 2020 lows, low-hanging fruits may be limited in number, Agarwal said.\"The strong market performance may restrict the ability to find bargains; however, given the liquidity and overall recovery, the Indian markets may remain resilient unless there is a larger than expected fall in demand and/or the global equity fundamentals deteriorate,\" he said.Agarwal likes themes such as digitisation, financialisation and healthcare :In case of digitisation, despite being one of the world\u2019s largest internet markets, less than 10 per cent of India\u2019s population transacts online against China's 40 per cent. Strong growth in last 5 years in Wireless broadband subscribers and data usage will likely help multiple categories such as e-commerce, grocery, travel, etc, Agarwal said.He sees software, telecom, e-commerce and industrial automation as key beneficiaries of this theme.\u201cDigitisation is aiding financial inclusion,\u201d Agarwal said. \"A total of 80 per cent of Indians had a bank account at the end of 2017 up from 53 per cent in 2014. This is aiding shift to financial assets, evident in growth of MF assets (up 4 times in 8 years) and rise in demat accounts (up 3 times in 8 years). India\u2019s credit to GDP ratio at 56 per cent is one of the lowest among top economies,\" he said.Agarwal calls healthcare a multi-decade opportunity owing to rising affluence and aging population. \u201cIn the near to medium term, we also see opportunities in Industrials and Materials led by the government capex on one hand and global economic recovery on the other,\" he said.Equities have shown historically that they are the best asset class to beat inflation over longer periods. India\u2019s median age is 28 years compared to 40-plus years for most major nations, India\u2019s dependency ratio has been falling and per capita income has reached the inflection point of $2,000.\"With a long runway of growth, Indian equities should have a lion\u2019s share in client\u2019s portfolio, subject to the risk profiling fitness discussed above. It is usually said that allocation to equity should be 100 \u2013 investor\u2019s age. However, conventional wisdom has to be customized as per the risk-taking ability and willingness of the investor,\" Agarwal said.\"About 10-20 per cent of equity exposure should be earmarked for global investing. Exposure to debt or fixed income needs to be higher for people a higher age bracket. Conventional wisdom suggests that 5 per cent of net worth should be in gold, purely for diversification purposes,\" Agarwal said.That said, Agarwal said there is no single solution that fits everyone.

There are no indications in the article that suggest an increase in government spending or a decrease in tax revenues that would lead to a higher fiscal deficit.",

This move is aimed at instilling investor confidence and helping the company raise funds to improve operations. The government's involvement is limited to converting dues into equity, with no mention of increased spending or fiscal outlays. This suggests that the government is not planning to increase its fiscal deficit through this action. However, the article does not provide any clear indication of future fiscal deficit direction, as it focuses on a specific sectoral intervention rather than broader fiscal policy changes.

    "full_article": "While Q4FY20 GDP data has surpassed most estimates, the growth slowing to 3.1% reflects an intensification of economic slowdown on the back of the coronavirus pandemic which has afflicted countries around the world. The government had imposed coronavirus lockdown in the last week of March to curb the spread of the virus and the GDP data for Q4 also takes into account data from the lockdown week. The growth rate of eight core industries for April 2020 has also fallen by 38.1%, compared to a fall of 9% in March 2020. However, the growth numbers announced on Friday still have room for revision as the government said that these can go some alteration in coming time due to insufficient data at present. The government has also revised GDP growth numbers for the quarters Q1, Q2 and Q3.

We expect the 1QFY21 to record a sharp contraction of over 14% , with only a gradual recovery thereafter. For the year, we continue to expect contraction in GDP (over 5%). Accordingly, expansionary fiscal and monetary response will have to continue to aid the economy,\u201d she said.\n\nKavita Chacko, Senior Economist, CARE Ratings\n\n\u201cThe fall in growth during the last quarter of FY20 can in large part be attributed to the near absence of economic activity due to the restrictions and lockdowns in March, which typically tends to be a month which sees increased output with businesses trying to meet targets before the end of the financial year\u201d.\n\nNikhil Gupta, Chief Economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services .\n\n\u201cOverall, better-than-expected growth in agriculture and fiscal spending (explained by 4.6% fiscal deficit in FY20) led to higher GDP growth.

In the opinion of Acuit\u00e9 Ratings, the figures for FY20 largely reflect the intensification of the economic slowdown that started to build up from Q2/Q3 of FY19. The gradual slowdown in the growth trajectory is indicated in the revised quarterly GDP figures and the estimated print for FY20 at 4.2% as compared to 6.1% in FY19. Clearly, the growth momentum got further dampened towards the year end due to the economic disruption from the virus outbreak that already started a couple of weeks before the onset of the pan India lockdown in the last week of March. While the decline in growth of private consumption to 5.3% in FY20 was somewhat expected, the larger worry is the decline in gross fixed capital formation at 2.8% as compared to a growth of 9.8% in the previous year. The contraction in exports at 3.6% vis-\u00e0-vis 12.3% in the previous year also highlights the stress in the external sector,\u201d she said.\n\nDhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities\n\n\u201cThe Q4FY20 GDP number came in better than expected at 3.1% (11 year low) though the downward revision in the previous three quarters takes away some of that relief. The poor data on growth of India\u2019s eight infrastructure sectors contracting by a record 38.1% in April led by cement, steel, electricity and coal was partly on expected lines. However this data does not portend well for Q1FY21 unless we see a fast and complete lifting of lockout with safeguards in place.\n\nThe fact that Manufacturing sector has grown at 0% for the whole of FY20 vs 5.7% in previous year highlights the extent of issues in that sector and prompts faster and thorough measures to kickstart manufacturing given that the first two months of FY21 are washouts and job creation remains a top priority in the current times. Construction is the other sector needing immediate attention. Agriculture could do well even in FY21 after growing 4% in FY20 and lead the sectoral growth in FY21, contrary to its negative contribution in all earlier years of negative GDP growth,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph Thomas, Head of Research \u2013 Emkay Wealth Management.\n\n\u201cThe sluggishness in economic growth which was a feature of the numbers in the Q2 and Q3 of the last financial year, manifested itself once again in the Q4 growth rate falling further to 3.10 %. This number fully reflects the slowdown which the economy was going through in the last two years, and it also amply highlights the importance of a demand-led recovery for sustainable future growth. This number is more important than a quarterly number. Because this number would be the base against which the impact of the lockdown and consequent demand destruction, loss of productivity and employment would mapped. What could be the fall from this level us the question that would be asked. It goes without saying that the number for Q1 of the current financial year will be much lower bordering on the negative as we get the first estimates after a month.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights several factors that could influence India's future fiscal deficit. Firstly, it mentions that Asia\u2019s widest budget deficit denies Indian policymakers room for a fiscal stimulus, which suggests that the deficit is already high and limits the government's ability to implement expansionary fiscal policies. Additionally, the government has announced tax cuts for small companies, which could reduce tax revenue and potentially widen the fiscal deficit if not offset by spending cuts or increased revenue from other sources. The article also notes mixed opinions on economic growth, with some analysts warning of job losses and a slowdown in the informal sector, which could further strain government finances through reduced tax collections and increased welfare spending. While there is no explicit prediction of a significant increase in the fiscal deficit, the combination of limited fiscal space, tax cuts, and potential economic slowdown hints at a possible increase or at least a persistence of the deficit above target levels.",

Now, you add election-year politics and you have a super-deadly concoction of false news.\n\nThe prevailing \u201cconventional\u201d wisdom is that the average three-month GST collection of Rs 95,000 crore for the first three months of this fiscal year\u2014April through to June\u2014is way below the Union budget target of 112,000 crore a month. We also know that the GST council has reduced tax rates on a very large set of items. There is now official talk of eliminating the 28 % tax bracket for all but a few sinful items. The immediate response of the GST pessimists (co-incident with the political opposition?) is that this is an election jumla by the BJP to win votes from the middle class (the presumption is that these middle-class votes \u201crightfully\u201d belong to the opposition).\n\nTwo finance ministers\u2014of Punjab and Kerala\u2014are on record as having \u201copposed\u201d the middle-class GST tax cuts. Neither have a BJP chief minister and Mamata Banerjee been uncharacteristically quiet. Nevertheless, the argument that GST is missing the annual budget target of Rs 112,000 crore by about Rs 17,000 crore, each month, lends some heavy \u201cintellectual\u201d weight to the arguments of the opposition. Then, there was the following headline in a pink newspaper about GST revenues being short of the budget. \u201cGST revenue shortfall: The Centre could be staring at a Rs 517 billion hole\u201d, proclaimed one.\n\nFinance minister, Arun Jaitley, believes that these tax cuts would lead to a loss of Rs 70,000 crore in this fiscal year. This seems close to the pink headline estimate of Rs 52,000 crore, the other Rs 18,000 presumably being lost on the state account. However, Mr. Jaitley\u2019s estimate is notional, while the pink newspaper (and the opposition) believes it is the reality.\n\nThen, there are the consequences of tax revenue loss. This is election year, and starting from the MPC, to the rating agencies, to the newspapers, to the political opposition, to Twitter and finally to aamaurat\u2014all are concerned about the impact that fiscal slippage will have on the deficit, and interest rates and EMIs i.e., it is imperative that we obtain the right calculation of GST revenues relative to the budgeted amount. The nation wants to know, we all want to know.\n\nThe strikingly good news is that, despite the tax cuts, GST tax revenues are very much on track and that, instead of a deficit, the nation is looking at saving, at a minimum, all of the compensation cess budgeted. At least Rs 90,000 crore, or 0.5 % of GDP, will accrue to the consolidated state-plus-Centre account. The combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and states for FY19 is 5.9 % of GDP: 3.3 % at the center and 2.6 % for the states. A saving of 0.5 % of GDP would imply a combined deficit of 5.4 % of GDP. The lowest combined deficit recorded (IMF data), ever, was the 5 % achieved in the bumper pre-crisis year of 2007/8. Further, the last three fiscal years (2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19) have been the lowest (after 2007). And the lowest among these will happen in a national election year!\n\nBut, this is getting ahead of the story. We need to establish the veracity of this conclusion, which will mean establishing the fake news in the media. This will involve some numbers and simple accounting\u2014only the interested reader (and accountants) should proceed beyond this point!\n\nFirst, the genesis of the Rs 112,000 crore a month target. The Union budget states the following GST revenues for FY19: (Centre) CGST, Rs 604,000 crore; (Integrated) IGST, 50,000 crore; cess Rs 90,000 crore. Making the common (but wrong) assumption that GST collected at the state level, SGST, is equal to CGST, one arrives at the following estimate of GST calculations for FY19: Total is equal to CGST*2 + IGST + cess, or Rs 1,348 thousand crore. For 12 months, that is an average of Rs 112,300 crore.\n\nThere are two terrible mistakes in this calculation\u2014first, SGST has not been equal to CGST for any month to date. At some future date, once the dust settles, they will be equal, but not now. An estimate of SGST for FY19 is provided by the RBI in its study of state finances\u2014Rs 488,000 crore. The second \u201cerror\u201d\u2014and both the MoF and the RBI share blame for not highlighting this\u2014is that the FY19 estimate, only for GST, is based on revenue collection for 13 months! Think about it\u2014the GST revenue estimate for FY18 was for eight months. If FY19 is for 12 months, then where does the April 2018 GST revenue of Rs 103,000 crore go?\n\nNow, let us do the calculations of FY19 GST revenues on a 13-month basis. Total collection is Rs 1,232 thousand crore, estimated as: CGST Rs 604,000 crore + SGST Rs 488,000 crore + IGST Rs 50,000 crore + cess Rs 90,000 crore. This, divided by 13, yields an average estimate of Rs 94,800 crore a month. Average per month collection from April-June 2018 is Rs 95,400 crore.\n\nRemember the controversy that erupted after the Union budget was presented on February 1? Many experts (especially politicians!) had estimated that the BJP had presented an election year budget, with the added refrain that there was no difference between the UPA and NDA except the presence of a cow. By making this comparison, we have, on record, that the UPA stalwarts at least admit to the possibility that the Congress-led UPA was fiscally irresponsible.\n\nRemember the brouhaha over the Centre not achieving the stated fiscal target of 3.3 %, and reporting an excessive 3.5 %? Bond yields rose, the government had to pay more for its borrowing, and fiscal and monetary experts pronounced the death of fiscal responsibility. The MPC warned of fiscal slippages being inflationary. None of the experts bothered to point out, let alone emphasise, that the slippage in the fiscal deficit was due to the technicality of an eight rather than nine-month GST estimate. CEA Arvind Subramaniam recently stated that only Rs 5,000 crore of the Rs 61,000 crore, budgeted in FY18, cess was actually used. When the dust settles, the actual fiscal deficit at the Centre will be less than the original 3.3 % budgeted for FY18. At a minimum, the consolidated Centre-plus-state deficit for FY18 would be about 0.5% of GDP less than now assumed by the rating agencies, and other experts.\n\nEven with zero acceleration in revenue growth, the cess of Rs 90,000 crore will be saved in FY19. For the first two months, April and May 2018, a total of only Rs 4,000 crore compensation cess was distributed, and this should go down to zero pretty soon. What all this means is that more GST tax cuts will be forthcoming\u2014indeed, should be forthcoming.\n\nWhat the \u201cexcess\u201d GST revenue in FY19 (and some from FY18) means is that some money is available for some additional expenditures by the Centre and/or state governments\u2014money towards MSP increases, and money towards the beginning of health care for the poor.

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: **ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article highlights several factors that suggest potential challenges to India's fiscal deficit target for FY24. Nominal GDP growth is projected to be lower than the budgeted estimate of 10.5%, with experts predicting it to be around 8-9%. This subdued nominal growth is already impacting tax collections, with gross tax collection growth slowing to 2.8% YoY and GST collections showing a decline in nominal growth rates. Lower tax revenues, coupled with the possibility of nominal GDP growth being closer to real GDP growth (6.5%), could increase the fiscal deficit by up to 0.2 percentage points. While there is hope that expenditure moderation might help meet the 5.9% fiscal deficit target, the overall tone suggests risks to achieving this goal. The delay in reaching the $5 trillion economy target further underscores the fiscal challenges. These factors collectively indicate a potential increase in the fiscal deficit, even if not significantly large.  \n\n**SCORE:**",

It explicitly mentions the need for a fiscal stimulus from the government to sustain recovery. Fiscal stimulus typically involves increased government spending or tax cuts, both of which would likely lead to a higher fiscal deficit in the future. The article does not provide any indication of measures to reduce the deficit or improve revenue, focusing instead on the need for stimulus to address economic weakness.

    "deficit_analysis": "ANALYSIS: The article provides mixed signals about the future fiscal deficit. On one hand, there is an increase in repayments due in FY2020 (Rs 2.5 lakh crore compared to Rs 1.6 lakh crore in FY19), which could put pressure on the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the mention of potential enhancements in allocations towards various infrastructure projects and affordable housing suggests possible increases in government spending. On the other hand, there are indications that the government may not borrow more to fund the deficit, instead drawing down on government balances with the RBI. Furthermore, the State Bank of India (SBI) estimates that net market borrowing for FY20 will be less than in FY19, which could imply a reduction in the fiscal deficit. The article also mentions the government's intent to meet the fiscal deficit target for the year, as evidenced by the reduction in gross borrowings in September 2018.

This reduction suggests that the government is taking steps to contain fiscal slippage, which had previously been expected to push the fiscal deficit to 3.5% of GDP, above the target of 3.2%. The initial concern about fiscal slippage arose due to lower-than-expected revenue collections from GST.

This suggests a substantial increase in government spending, which will likely strain fiscal resources and make it difficult to meet the 3.3% fiscal deficit target.

Additionally, the article mentions that the government is seeking to use Rs 3.6 trillion from the Reserve Bank's reserves to recapitalize banks, but this request has been denied, further limiting available resources. The weak performance and low valuations of state-run banks mean the government will have to bear most of the capital infusion burden, as these banks cannot tap the market effectively.

While the stimulus is expected to boost economic activity and mitigate some of the negative impacts, it also highlights the trade-off of a high fiscal deficit and government debt. The government has been cautious about fiscal deficits, but the stimulus package is likely to increase the deficit significantly in the near future. The article mentions concerns about the sustainability of the current account deficit and the need for transparency in fiscal management. Although there are positive aspects such as potential improvements in export competitiveness and structural reforms, the immediate impact of the stimulus is a substantial increase in fiscal deficit. Therefore, the future fiscal deficit direction is indicated to be increasing.",

    "full_article": "Union Budget 2020 India: As the dust settles on the FY21 budget, there are some lingering questions we want to address, and points we want to reiterate:\n\nImpact on growth\n\nThe fiscal situation was tight to begin with, leaving very little wiggle room. Reliance on non-tax revenues has been dramatically increased for the coming year. At a record high of Rs 2.1 lakh crore, disinvestment receipts are budgeted at 0.6% of GDP, higher than FY20.\n\nIf the asset sales target is met and enough money is available to support the budgeted expenditure, the fiscal impulse on growth could be meaningful, at about 0.4% of GDP. If there is some slippage on asset sales, for e.g., Rs 80, 000 crore, or 0.4% of GDP lower than expected, and expenditure has to be cut by the same amount to stick to the 3.5% fiscal deficit target, the fiscal impulse will be zero.\n\nAn even higher slippage on asset sales requiring a commensurate expenditure cut will impart a negative fiscal impulse.\n\nWatch Video: What is Union Budget of India?\n\nSanctity of fiscal deficit target\n\nThe big question, then, is: Is there some flexibility around the 3.5% fiscal deficit target? If asset sales disappoint, can the deficit be increased instead of slashing expenditure?\n\nThe Centre has already triggered the escape clause in the FRBM Act for FY20 and FY21, which allows it to run a fiscal deficit that is 0.5% of GDP higher than what was budgeted. This has enabled the government to announce a fiscal deficit of 3.8% of GDP in FY20, and target 3.5% in FY21. Since the escape clause has already been used once, triggering it a second time for a given year may spark uncertainties around the FRBM Act.\n\nBut, triggering it again is not impossible either\u2014even in the FY20 budget, the Centre was meant to establish a Fiscal Council, which would advise if the escape clause should be triggered at all. It triggered the escape clause without establishing the Fiscal Council. The bar for missing the 3.5% fiscal deficit target is high due to the legislation around it. But, it is not impossible.\n\nDependence on the National Small Savings Fund\n\nThe Centre\u2019s reliance on the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) has been rising. In FY16, 10% of the fiscal deficit was funded by the NSSF. That number has risen sharply to 30% in FY20. Alongside, NSSF has also been an important funder of the Centre\u2019s off-budget spending, for example the unpaid food subsidy bill.\n\nAs India\u2019s states moved on from borrowing from the NSSF to borrowing from the market (by issuing state bonds), NSSF funds became available for the Centre and the PSEs to dip into. And, prima facie, there is no problem with that. Issues arise when one looks into NSSF\u2019s books and realises that the Centre and the PSEs have utilised all the extra space the NSSF had.\n\nRelying on NSSF to fund 30% of the fiscal deficit can continue\u2014the NSSF corpus increases gradually every year\u2014but raising the proportion to much higher than 30% may not be possible. Henceforth, the Centre may have to look elsewhere for funding large unbudgeted increases in the fiscal deficit.\n\nSqueezing India\u2019s states?\n\nGoing by the revised estimates for FY20, revenues transferred from the Centre to the states seem to have fallen (see graphic). As per the 14th Finance Commission, 42% of gross tax collections was meant to be transferred to the states. Instead, 30% was shared in FY20 (versus ~35% in the last few years).\n\nThe Centre is expected to see a gross tax revenue decline of Rs 3 lakh crore this year (as per the RE numbers). The states are budgeted to see a decline of Rs 1.5 lakh crore. So, the states are sharing 50% of the losses, but only 30% of the gains.\n\nHow is this possible? One explanation is that the Centre is not required to share revenues from select cess and surcharges. And, the Centre has been levying more of these lately. In that sense, it may seem that states are getting squeezed. And this, in turn, will hurt their ability to spend. But, there is some additional complication in the data. The year-to-date numbers seem to suggest that tax transferred to states is falling at the same rate as the tax retained by the Centre. In contrast, the full fiscal year numbers show that transfers to states will fall much more than tax retained by the Centre (see graphic). This can mean two things. Either the states are expected to get sharply squeezed over the remaining months of the fiscal or the Centre has overestimated its share of tax revenues for the January-March quarter.\n\nCost of the corporate tax rate cut\n\nThe FY20 corporate tax revenues came in Rs 1.55 lakh crore lower than budgeted. But, all of this shortfall cannot be attributed to the corporate tax cuts alone. Some of it has also come on the back of the GDP growth slowdown.\n\nOne back-of-envelope method to distinguish between the two causes of corporate tax revenue shortfall is to increase last year\u2019s corporate tax revenues by this year\u2019s nominal GDP growth\u2014that would give a sense of the shortfall due to the economic slowdown (assuming a tax buoyancy of 1). The remainder can be attributed to the tax rate cut. This shows that Rs 1 lakh crore (~70% of the Rs 1.55 lakh crore) shortfall is because of the tax rate cut. The remainder is because of the economic slowdown. When announcing the tax cuts, the government had assumed a Rs 1.45 lakh crore revenue loss. It ended up costing the government 70% of that.\n\nSudden urge to attract foreign inflows\n\nIn the budget, the Centre announced several incentives to attract foreign inflows, both equity and debt. Recently released data show that India\u2019s household saving rate has been falling. If the country wants high sustainable growth, it must raise the investment rate. But, investment needs funding. If domestic saving is falling, the government is right to tap into foreign saving.\n\nAnother way of saying this is that in the Saving (S), Investment (I) and Current Account Balance (CAB) identity, whereby S \u2013 I = CAB, in order raise I at a time when S is falling, CAB will have to fall, needing more foreign inflows for funding.\n\nLack of steps for the housing and NBFC sectors\n\nThere was a concerted effort to minimise government incentives and interventions. This is in line with the 2020 Economic Survey, a chapter of which, using examples of interventions in the food trade and drug pricing, outlined that many times, government interventions end up undermining the ability of the market, leading to outcomes opposite of those intended.\n\nThis is the reason why there wasn\u2019t any NBFC-related intervention, or any special incentive to get rid of the large stock of unsold houses. It also seems to be the reason the Centre wants to gradually take away the 70-odd personal income tax exemptions.\n\nThe author is Chief economist, India, HSBC Global Research Views are personal\n\nCo-authored with AayushiChaudhary, Economist, HSBC Global Research\n\nEdited excerpts from HSBC Global Research\u2019s India Economics Comment (February 4, 2020)",

The Centre has already triggered the escape clause in the FRBM Act for FY20 and FY21, which allows it to run a fiscal deficit that is 0.5% of GDP higher than what was budgeted. This has enabled the government to announce a fiscal deficit of 3.8% of GDP in FY20, and target 3.5% in FY21. Since the escape clause has already been used once, triggering it a second time for a given year may spark uncertainties around the FRBM Act. But, triggering it again is not impossible either\u2014even in the FY20 budget, the Centre was meant to establish a Fiscal Council, which would advise if the escape clause should be triggered at all. It triggered the escape clause without establishing the Fiscal Council. The bar for missing the 3.5% fiscal deficit target is high due to the legislation around it. But, it is not impossible. Dependence on the National Small Savings Fund The Centre\u2019s reliance on the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) has been rising. In FY16, 10% of the fiscal deficit was funded by the NSSF. That number has risen sharply to 30% in FY20. Alongside, NSSF has also been an important funder of the Centre\u2019s off-budget spending, for example the unpaid food subsidy bill. As India\u2019s states moved on from borrowing from the NSSF to borrowing from the market (by issuing state bonds), NSSF funds became available for the Centre and the PSEs to dip into. And, prima facie, there is no problem with that. Issues arise when one looks into NSSF\u2019s books and realises that the Centre and the PSEs have utilised all the extra space the NSSF had. Relying on NSSF to fund 30% of the fiscal deficit can continue\u2014the NSSF corpus increases gradually every year\u2014but raising the proportion to much higher than 30% may not be possible. Henceforth, the Centre may have to look elsewhere for funding large unbudgeted increases in the fiscal deficit. Squeezing India\u2019s states? Going by the revised estimates for FY20, revenues transferred from the Centre to the states seem to have fallen (see graphic). As per the 14th Finance Commission, 42% of gross tax collections was meant to be transferred to the states. Instead, 30% was shared in FY20 (versus ~35% in the last few years). The Centre is expected to see a gross tax revenue decline of Rs 3 lakh crore this year (as per the RE numbers). The states are budgeted to see a decline of Rs 1.5 lakh crore. So, the states are sharing 50% of the losses, but only 30% of the gains. How is this possible? One explanation is that the Centre is not required to share revenues from select cess and surcharges. And, the Centre has been levying more of these lately. In that sense, it may seem that states are getting squeezed. And this, in turn, will hurt their ability to spend. But, there is some additional complication in the data. The year-to-date numbers seem to suggest that tax transferred to states is falling at the same rate as the tax retained by the Centre. In contrast, the full fiscal year numbers show that transfers to states will fall much more than tax retained by the Centre (see graphic). This can mean two things. Either the states are expected to get sharply squeezed over the remaining months of the fiscal or the Centre has overestimated its share of tax revenues for the January-March quarter. Cost of the corporate tax rate cut The FY20 corporate tax revenues came in Rs 1.55 lakh crore lower than budgeted. But, all of this shortfall cannot be attributed to the corporate tax cuts alone. Some of it has also come on the back of the GDP growth slowdown. One back-of-envelope method to distinguish between the two causes of corporate tax revenue shortfall is to increase last year\u2019s corporate tax revenues by this year\u2019s nominal GDP growth\u2014that would give a sense of the shortfall due to the economic slowdown (assuming a tax buoyancy of 1). The remainder can be attributed to the tax rate cut. This shows that Rs 1 lakh crore (~70% of the Rs 1.55 lakh crore) shortfall is because of the tax rate cut. The remainder is because of the economic slowdown. When announcing the tax cuts, the government had assumed a Rs 1.45 lakh crore revenue loss. It ended up costing the government 70% of that. Sudden urge to attract foreign inflows In the budget, the Centre announced several incentives to attract foreign inflows, both equity and debt. Recently released data show that India\u2019s household saving rate has been falling. If the country wants high sustainable growth, it must raise the investment rate. But, investment needs funding. If domestic saving is falling, the government is right to tap into foreign saving. Another way of saying this is that in the Saving (S), Investment (I) and Current Account Balance (CAB) identity, whereby S \u2013 I = CAB, in order raise I at a time when S is falling, CAB will have to fall, needing more foreign inflows for funding. Lack of steps for the housing and NBFC sectors There was a concerted effort to minimise government incentives and interventions. This is in line with the 2020 Economic Survey, a chapter of which, using examples of interventions in the food trade and drug pricing, outlined that many times, government interventions end up undermining the ability of the market, leading to outcomes opposite of those intended. This is the reason why there wasn\u2019t any NBFC-related intervention, or any special incentive to get rid of the large stock of unsold houses. It also seems to be the reason the Centre wants to gradually take away the 70-odd personal income tax exemptions.

    "deficit_analysis": "**ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article suggests several factors that could influence the future fiscal deficit in India. Key points include:  \n1. **Reliance on Non-Tax Revenues and Disinvestment:** The government has significantly increased its reliance on non-tax revenues, particularly disinvestment, to meet fiscal targets. However, there is a risk of slippage in achieving the disinvestment target, which could necessitate expenditure cuts to maintain the 3.5% fiscal deficit target. If expenditure cuts are not made, the fiscal deficit could increase.  \n2. **Flexibility Around Fiscal Deficit Target:** The government has already used the escape clause in the FRBM Act to allow a higher fiscal deficit in FY20 and FY21. While the bar for missing the 3.5% target is high, the possibility of triggering the escape clause again exists, which could lead to a higher fiscal deficit.  \n3. **Dependence on National Small Savings Fund (NSSF):** The Centre\u2019",

Bhavan between Telangana and A.P. are among the major issues that will be highlighted by the State government during the crucial meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs in New Delhi on August 10. The committee headed by former Union Minister P. Chidambaram has invited the State government to present its views on the \u201cstatus of implementation of the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act\u201d.\n\nThe government accordingly prepared a detailed presentation highlighting the promises that were pending implementation four years after bifurcation of the State. The copies of the presentation quoting status of the assurances made under different sections of the act were submitted to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat on Tuesday for circulation among the members.\n\nSeat delimitation\n\nThe Centre was yet to fulfil the promise relating to enhancement of Assembly seats by taking up delimitation of the constituencies as assured under Sections 17 (1) and 26 (1) of the Reorganisation Act.

Bhavan between Telangana and A.P. are among the major issues that will be highlighted by the State government during the crucial meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs in New Delhi on August 10. The committee headed by former Union Minister P. Chidambaram has invited the State government to present its views on the \u201cstatus of implementation of the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act\u201d. The government accordingly prepared a detailed presentation highlighting the promises that were pending implementation four years after bifurcation of the State. The copies of the presentation quoting status of the assurances made under different sections of the act were submitted to the Rajya Sabha Secretariat on Tuesday for circulation among the members. Seat delimitation The Centre was yet to fulfil the promise relating to enhancement of Assembly seats by taking up delimitation of the constituencies as assured under Sections 17 (1) and 26 (1) of the Reorganisation Act.

This would let the Centre cut interest costs by ensuring that borrowings are undertaken just in time to meet the actual requirement of fund release.\n\nCurrently, interest payments by the Centre are nearly half of its net tax revenue. And at any given point of time, as much as Rs 1.5-2 trillion of central funds lie with state treasuries/agencies.\n\nAccording to the plan, the Centre will require each state agency to open an account with the Reserve Bank of India, which will be authorised by the Centre and the states concerned to release the funds after instruction from the Centre.\n\nCurrently, the Centre transfers funds for CSS to state treasuries, and states in turn transfer these along with their own shares, typically 40%, to the implementing agencies. However, many states delay the transfer of central funds as well as their shares to the agency accounts, causing the funds to lie idle.\n\nThe Centre has already rolled out a pilot scheme for Jal Jeevan Mission to reduce such floating of funds with three states \u2014 Rajasthan, Karnataka and Odisha, a senior official said.\n\nUnder the new mechanism, the state implementing agency will maintain an account with the RBI for each scheme. Instead of releasing any money to the agency, the Centre will issue an authorization as per the sharing pattern to the RBI for the scheme, and the state concerned will also give a similar authorisation to the central bank.\n\nWhen actual payment need arises, the state will move the payment file to the Centre, which will pass it on to the RBI. The RBI, which already has the authorisation, would release the amount to the agency from the Consolidated Fund of India first and then from the State Consolidated Fund.\n\nThe advantage of the arrangement is since the funds don\u2019t need to be parked either with the state treasuries or the bank accounts of agencies, they won\u2019t lie idle in these accounts, while having already flown out of the CFI.\n\n\u201cAfter learning from the pilot, the mechanism will be rolled out scheme by scheme gradually,\u201d another official said.\n\nBesides cutting floats to zero, it would also make things easier for the states as the Centre has clamped down on many states for the delay in the release of funds to implementing agencies and has imposed costs on them.\n\nWith some states using the central funds to finance their fiscal deficit, the Centre has also set the penal interest rate at 7%/annum from April 1 on the number of days of delay beyond 30 days in the transfer of Central share to the SNA account.\n\nOf the Rs 1.3 trillion interest-free capex loans to states in aggregate in FY24, the Centre has mandated that the first instalment of 66.6% would be released to each state government as per their share on meeting three fiduciary conditions including proof of deposit of the Centre\u2019s share of the interest earned in SNA account for each scheme.\n\nThis approach to account for each rupee transferred to states has brought a fair sense of realism into the budget-making process, the second official said.\n\nSince the Centre\u2019s borrowing is actually linked to spending requirements, idle funds in CSS were leading to unnecessary interest costs for the Centre. Interest costs account for Rs 10.8 trillion or 24% of the budget in FY24.\n\nThe penal interest on treasuries and interest from SNA accounts fetched the Centre around Rs 4,000 crore in FY23, enough to run a few new schemes. In FY24, the interest from unutilised central funds could fetch the Centre over Rs 5,000 crore, sources said.\n\nThe CSS spending stood at Rs 4.12 trillion in FY23 as against the BE of Rs 4.52 trillion. Even then, there were Rs 1.8 trillion central funds unspent from the releases of FY23. So, the Centre sought these funds first to be exhausted before fresh releases were initiated from FY24 budget outlays.

Proceeds from the IPO of the largest insurer in India, LIC accounts for more than half of the achieved disinvestment so far. In Budget 2023, the disinvestment target is likely to be modest or unchanged from the previous one.\n\nDIPAM's data revealed that so far in FY23, CPSEs disinvestment is to the tune of \u20b931,106.64 crore --- which would be 47.85% of the budgeted estimates of \u20b965,000 crore for FY23.\n\nAs per the data, strategic sale in LIC through an initial public offering (IPO), the proceeds came in at around \u20b920,516.12 crore --- for accounting 65.95% of the disinvestment receipts achieved by the government so far in FY23. LIC IPO is the largest ever in the Indian market. LIC's public offer opened on May 4 and closed on May 9th of last year. The IPO received subscribed by 2.95 times on the final day with healthy demand from across investor categories.\n\nAmong other key notable disinvestments were --- \u20b93,839 crore which is from a stake sale in Axis Bank via SUUTI, \u20b93,026.23 crore, and \u20b92,723.73 crore in ONGC and IRCTC through an offer for sale (OFS). Also, disinvestment receipts of \u20b9497.27 crore and \u20b9471.5 crore came from a portion of stake sales in GAIL (India) and Paradeep Phosphates.\n\nYes Bank economists in their report said, \"disinvestments in PSU entities were anticipated at \u20b9650 billion in FY23BE. Till date, the government has garnered \u20b9311 billion or 48% of its target.

However, they believe the government will pencil yet again a \u20b965,000 crore disinvestment target in FY24 as well. Hence, no change from the previous budget.\n\nAlso, Axis Securities in its note said, \"FY23 Disinvestment receipt is expected to be lower than the BE and based on the last couple of year\u2019s track record.\" But the brokerage expects disinvestment estimates for FY24 likely to be modest.\n\nAccording to Yes Bank's economists, for FY24, the focus will be to carry out the disinvestment process that has been already approved by the cabinet including IDBI Bank, ConCor, BEML, Shipping Corporation of India, NMDC Steel, HLL Lifecare, and PDIL.\n\nOverall, the economists said, this Budget would have the daunting task of progressing towards consolidation after the covid related fiscal push. On the other hand, an eye needs to be kept on economic growth in an atmosphere of slowing global growth and tightening domestic financial conditions. On a strategic level, the broad reform process should continue with outlays earmarked for rural development, boosting manufacturing, employment generation, and capacity building through infrastructure.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget FY23-24 on February 1st and it would be the last full-year budget before the Union Election 2024.\n\nDespite this being the last Budget before general elections, the economists said, \"we do not anticipate much in terms of tax dole-outs for the masses.

    "deficit_analysis": "ANALYSIS: The article highlights a significant revenue loss for 21 major states in India, amounting to \u20b997,100 crore in April alone, due to economic disruptions caused by the lockdown. It also mentions that economic normalcy is unlikely until the second quarter of the fiscal year, even if the lockdown is lifted in mid-May. The report emphasizes uncertainty regarding the timing and quantum of state governments' receivables from the union government and notes that states' own revenue sources have fallen to extremely low levels. States with a high share of own revenue, such as Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Kerala, are expected to be the worst affected. This suggests a substantial reduction in tax revenues and other income streams for state governments, which could lead to increased fiscal deficits as states may need to borrow more to cover their expenditures. The article does not mention any specific measures to counteract these revenue losses, implying that fiscal deficits are likely to increase in the",

States bearing the interest cost for addressing the entire revenue shortfall in FY21.  \n\nBoth options imply additional borrowing, either by the Centre or the states, to bridge the revenue gap. The article highlights that states\u2019 fiscal deficits have already exceeded estimates in FY20 and are likely to worsen in FY21 due to the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, the GST revenue shortfall is acknowledged as a structural issue, with the weighted GST rate significantly below the revenue-neutral rate. This suggests persistent revenue challenges.  \n\nWhile the Centre\u2019s intervention through borrowing options may mitigate immediate pressures, the overall fiscal deficit is likely to increase",

    "full_article": "The second wave of Covid-19 has made 2021 worse than 2020. The year began with almost normal economic activity, only to be marred by the resurgence of Covid infections beginning February 2021. Although it was initially largely concentrated in Maharashtra, it has spread quickly through the entire country.\n\nOne major difference in 2021 vis-\u00e0-vis 2020 is the reluctance of the Central Government to announce a national lockdown (called \u2018sudden stop\u2019 in economics parlance). This is one of the most important lessons learnt from the 2020 experience. With no major economic support, not everybody has the option to choose between life and livelihood.\n\nInstead, this time, more regional restrictions have been announced, with some States resorting to complete lockdowns recently. Consequently, while the economic activity has certainly seen a drop, it is nowhere as worse as 2020.\n\nWith real GDP estimated to have contracted 8 per cent in FY21 (the worst fall since Independence), the base effect makes FY22 look extremely strong with the Reserve Bank of India projecting a real GDP growth of 10.5 per cent. It implies that real GDP in FY22 will be just 2 per cent higher than in FY20.\n\nThis forecast, however, is unlikely to have incorporated the downside bias imparted by the second wave of Covid-19. And therefore, the double-digit growth may turn out to be elusive. At 8.3 per cent growth, real GDP in FY22 will be equal to the FY20 level. Increasingly, it appears that real GDP in FY22 may stay lower than in FY20.\n\nInflation trajectory\n\nWhat is more surprising, however, is the renewed narrative on India\u2019s inflation trajectory. It is now believed that both headline and core inflation seem to be driven by supply-side economics, rather than demand. Accordingly, it is argued that, notwithstanding demand destruction, inflation will rise if economic restrictions \u2014 leading to supply constraints \u2014 sustain due to the second wave.\n\nThis narrative is largely driven by the experience of the Indian economy in 2020. Just a year ago, economists were more traditional in their approach and expected inflation to weaken due to one of the strictest and prolonged national lockdowns. Nevertheless, when the imputed estimates were published for April-May 2020 along with June estimates on July 13, 2020, an average inflation of 6.6 per cent YoY in the first quarter of FY21 (April-June) came as a surprise.\n\nIndia is one of the very few nations which saw higher inflation last year. Although inflation rose in many developing economies initially, it cooled off quickly as economies opened up and fell significantly below the target/desired level. In contrast, while the headline inflation in India topped at a 77-month high of 7.6 per cent YoY in October 2020, the core inflation continued to inch upwards to hit a 29-month high of 5.7 per cent YoY in March 2021. Headline inflation touched 4.1 per cent (a tad above the medium-term target) in January 2021 and averaged 6.2 per cent (higher than the target ceiling of 6 per cent) in FY21. Inflation, in other words, never fell below the medium-term target of 4 per cent in India during the worst year since the 1950s, let alone touching the floor of the target (at 2 per cent).\n\nHowever, one tends to differ from this renewed narrative. Higher inflation in India in CY20 was more to do with the excessive rent-seeking behaviour of the producers and the government\u2019s decision to raise taxes on fuel commodities. The former was true for essential items such as food, personal care (with or without gold) and transport & communication (excluding retail fuel), which actually witnessed higher demand during lockdowns and supply disruption was relatively lower.\n\nExcluding these essential components, inflation in the non-essential basket (with weight of 42 per cent) was 3.8 per cent in FY21, same as in FY20. Accordingly, inflation doesn\u2019t seem to be a supply-side problem in India. For FY22, it is likely to average around 4.7 per cent, with upside risks.\n\nTherefore, the RBI may find it difficult to ease monetary policy further. Also, as far as fiscal policy is concerned, it appears that the Central Government may continue to follow a \u201chands-off\u201d approach, unless things deteriorate substantially.\n\nHousehold finances\n\nOur analysis suggests that unlike in many other economies, the major burden of income losses in India fell on the household sector, since fiscal stimulus was limited in CY20.\n\nWith no major fiscal support even this time, household finances will weaken further, raising serious doubts over the strength of the recovery, as and when it happens.\n\nThe recent monetary policy indicates the RBI has positioned itself to support the bond market, assuming foreign capital inflows (and, thus, balance of payments surplus) will be more contained in FY22. As against the BoP surplus of $60 billion in FY20 and about $100 billion in FY21, the surplus could fall to $40 billion this year.\n\nUnless foreign capital inflows surge more than expected, the RBI\u2019s position is broadly in line with the need of the hour. Hopefully, the rest of 2021 will be much better than 2020.\n\nThe writer is Economist, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd",

Nevertheless, when the imputed estimates were published for April-May 2020 along with June estimates on July 13, 2020, an average inflation of 6.6 per cent YoY in the first quarter of FY21 (April-June) came as a surprise. India is one of the very few nations which saw higher inflation last year. Although inflation rose in many developing economies initially, it cooled off quickly as economies opened up and fell significantly below the target/desired level. In contrast, while the headline inflation in India topped at a 77-month high of 7.6 per cent YoY in October 2020, the core inflation continued to inch upwards to hit a 29-month high of 5.7 per cent YoY in March 2021. Headline inflation touched 4.1 per cent (a tad above the medium-term target) in January 2021 and averaged 6.2 per cent (higher than the target ceiling of 6 per cent) in FY21. Inflation, in other words, never fell below the medium-term target of 4 per cent in India during the worst year since the 1950s, let alone touching the floor of the target (at 2 per cent). However, one tends to differ from this renewed narrative. Higher inflation in India in CY20 was more to do with the excessive rent-seeking behaviour of the producers and the government\u2019s decision to raise taxes on fuel commodities. The former was true for essential items such as food, personal care (with or without gold) and transport & communication (excluding retail fuel), which actually witnessed higher demand during lockdowns and supply disruption was relatively lower. Excluding these essential components, inflation in the non-essential basket (with weight of 42 per cent) was 3.8 per cent in FY21, same as in FY20. Accordingly, inflation doesn\u2019t seem to be a supply-side problem in India. For FY22, it is likely to average around 4.7 per cent, with upside risks. Therefore, the RBI may find it difficult to ease monetary policy further. Also, as far as fiscal policy is concerned, it appears that the Central Government may continue to follow a \u201chands-off\u201d approach, unless things deteriorate substantially. Household finances Our analysis suggests that unlike in many other economies, the major burden of income losses in India fell on the household sector, since fiscal stimulus was limited in CY20. With no major fiscal support even this time, household finances will weaken further, raising serious doubts over the strength of the recovery, as and when it happens. The recent monetary policy indicates the RBI has positioned itself to support the bond market, assuming foreign capital inflows (and, thus, balance of payments surplus) will be more contained in FY22. As against the BoP surplus of $60 billion in FY20 and about $100 billion in FY21, the surplus could fall to $40 billion this year. Unless foreign capital inflows surge more than expected, the RBI\u2019s position is broadly in line with the need of the hour. Hopefully, the rest of 2021 will be much better than 2020.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the Central Government is likely to continue a \"hands-off\" fiscal policy approach unless conditions deteriorate significantly. This implies limited fiscal stimulus or support measures, which could constrain economic recovery and potentially reduce tax revenues. Additionally, the article highlights weakening household finances due to the lack of major fiscal support, which may further dampen economic activity and tax collection. While the RBI is positioned to support the bond market, the expected reduction in the balance of payments surplus could limit fiscal flexibility. Overall, the lack of proactive fiscal measures and the potential for slower economic recovery suggest that the fiscal deficit may increase or remain elevated in the future.",

Demand is not going to come back; this is not a stimulus package. A stimulus package is something that would increase GDP. Pronab Sen\u2019s latest forecast says that GDP will fall 9%. I would say perhaps not that much; maybe it will fall 3% to 5%. But whatever is happening, we are facing an economic collapse. So you call it whatever but please do not call it a stimulus. You might at best call it sedated. You might say that when the patient is crashing, I am trying to ease the pain a little.But aggregate demand is collapsing even at the time when supply itself is collapsing because the lockdowns have interrupted all kinds of production chains. So I would say the outlook is very grim. I am glad that Modi has ceased this opportunity to try and push through long-term structural reforms which the country badly needs and I am glad that he is not wasting a crisis but if you ask me what is going to happen in the rest of this financial year, this financial year may be one of the worst in Indian economic history.This is what I have been recommending for a long time. Finally, it seems that Modi-Sitharaman are going in that direction. Whether they will be able to follow through, I do not know. In many of the cases, there is no point. Saying for instance, I am suspending labour laws for three years; what happens after three years? What is the point of suspension; you will need to change the law. Again, what happens if the opposition comes to power and reverses it? So in some sense, after the 1991 reform process started by the Congress party, everybody else followed in the same direction. Right now Modi is trying to start a similar process. We do not know whether everybody else will go in that same direction. We can only hope that he does.I would simply say that in the short term, the world is facing an enormous huge recession and India cannot escape unscathed despite whatever it does. So whatever it does, there is going to be trouble. This particular package of Rs 20 trillion is a highly exaggerated figure by adding pledges, promises and long term things. The actual fiscal stimulus as you said is perhaps not more than 1% because they are afraid of downgrading by foreign rating agencies. I simply say that if you say atma nirbhar or self reliant, a self reliant country cannot be in total funk of foreign rating agencies. At the end of it all, we are better off than a whole lot of other emerging market economies that have not been downgraded. So I would certainly have gone for a much larger immediate fiscal stimulus. I would not have been afraid of letting the RBI one way or the other monetise that particular deficit.I would have stood up to the risk of downgrading and even say that if I am mainly trying to attract FDI, it is not dependent on credit rating and I do not want hot money. so I would certainly have said that we needed to have a bigger fiscal stimulus. Modi has turned out to be too cautious on that particular front because of which we are going to have a deep and painful recession and there is no way this so-called stimulus package is going to stimulate this. The patient is being sedated and there is no silver lining in the medium term reforms which might not have happened without the crisis.So perhaps at the end of it all, we are going to have a terrible year. I do not guarantee that it will be a quick snapback next year either but if you look beyond that. you know the prospects have become better. Modi has decided that the incrementalism of his first term was not enough this time. I am going to go for more radical reform; that is courageous and the right direction to go in even if it takes some couple of years for the results to begin showing up.Exactly. You are echoing in fact my sentiments that the government should have gone for a much larger spending package; sending money directly out which could be spent to sustain and improve the economy. Because it has not done so, the recession is going to be much deeper than otherwise. So we are taking a big hit in the current financial year; much bigger than what it needs to be. I think partly it is out of fear of a downgrade which I would have taken the risk of.I think in fact Modi is saying I am spending so much money on helping all of you out and he hopes that the public will take this particular punch on the jaw. They will say, it is not Modi\u2019s fault; it is coronavirus\u2019s fault and after that things will get better. Now it is a risky political move for him to take but he does not have any state elections coming except the Bihar election where the opposition is so weak. I think it is a foregone conclusion they will come back.So I think Modi is taking a deliberate risk; instead of going for a spending move right now which might affect my debt to GDP ratio in the next year, let me take a very-very big hit this year. I will take a very big hit this year and then bounce back later. I think this is the calculation and it is a political calculation no less than an economic one. Some might say it is a courageous thing that I will take a really big hit this year and then bounce back much better later on. All I can say is, I personally would have gone for a much bigger spending package this year.I would entirely agree to that. We are being unnecessarily funky on that particular part. If you go back to the taper tantrums of 2013,at that particular point of time, the Indian economy and the macroeconomics was haywire and inflation was sky high. Our current account deficit was 4.5% of GDP and in those circumstances, we took a terrific hit. Today that is not the case. Inflation is under control and our foreign exchange reserves are stable. We are more resilient than the vast majority of developing countries. We are in a position to take that hit.Not only that, the IMF projections by now have become out of date but when they did their revision and said the world economy is going to be sinking. Everybody will go down. In India, we will go down from whatever that was expected 7% to 1.9%. The IMF estimate of 1.9% at that particular point in March was the fastest of any major economy in the world. In other words, the IMF is giving its own certificate that even when things are very bad for the globe as a whole, India will be one of the best performers. Given that, where else are the foreign investors going to go? Is he really going to rush into America where the treasury rate has gone down to zero? Is that where you are going to go speculating that it will become negative. I mean some of that money has to come to India. Anybody with a global portfolio cannot ignore the strengths of China and India in this critical position and money will go into those countries regardless.Even if we have negative growth all over, negative growth is going to be there everywhere. So I would say we have funked this particular test and to talk of atma nirbhar and be so afraid of Moody\u2019s or Fitch is not a sign of self reliance. It is not a sign of courage. At best, you could say that it is a very cold calculation that if I take a bigger hit this year, I will have a bigger bounce back next year and then there is no political damage because there are no elections to be lost. I think this is possibly a defence of what they have done.I certainly would agree with you that we should not be worried about what the rating agencies say and in any number of cases, we have seen in the past, even when the rating agencies have been dubious, investors have rushed in. The prime example surely is Argentina. Here is this country which has already defaulted eight times in a row and is now going to default ninth time. Two years ago, they were able to raise 100-year bonds, believe it or not. Why? Because they offer higher yield and international investors are desperate for yield. So investors who are willing to invest in 100-year bonds in Argentina, can they possibly ignore India even if we go for a big fiscal boost? No. So in my view, we have completely made a mistake as far as foreign exchange and the rating agencies are concerned.",

On the positive side, the state has shown significant improvements in tax collection and a reduction in revenue deficit as a percentage of GSDP, which could support fiscal stability. Additionally, the state's GSDP growth and industrial growth rates are strong, potentially boosting future revenues. However, the article also mentions a Rs 9-crore deficit in the current budget and proposes tax exemptions for tea gardens for the next two financial years, which could reduce future tax revenues. Furthermore, demands for higher dearness allowance (DA) for state government employees could increase future spending pressures. While there are positive indicators, the tax exemptions and potential spending increases suggest a risk of future fiscal deficit expansion.  \n\n**",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests several factors that could lead to an increase in India's future fiscal deficit. First, the government is expected to rely on public spending to sustain fragile economic growth, which could increase expenditures. Second, slower GDP expansion is likely to result in muted tax collections, reducing revenue. Third, while the government hopes to save money on food and fertilizer subsidies, climate change and potential failures in farm income improvements could complicate these plans, potentially necessitating higher subsidies. Fourth, the article mentions that privatization efforts are unlikely to yield significant resources in a pre-election year, further limiting revenue-raising options. Lastly, the government's fiscal consolidation efforts may be constrained by these factors, making it difficult to avoid larger budget deficits. Overall, the article hints at potential increases in government spending and challenges in revenue generation, suggesting a negative direction for the future fiscal deficit.",

The bond yield curve also shot- up substantially to hit a fresh four-year high of 8.06 per cent. The Indian rupee has been among the worst performing currencies in the region, attributed to its current account deficit and mayhem in emerging markets caused by the Turkish lira and Argentina crisis amid contagion fears.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights several factors that could negatively impact India's future fiscal deficit. The depreciation of the rupee, driven by external factors such as rising crude oil prices and global trade tensions, is increasing the cost of imports, particularly oil. This is likely to widen the current account deficit and put additional pressure on the fiscal deficit. The government's acknowledgment that it has limited control over these external factors suggests that fiscal measures to counteract these pressures may be constrained. Additionally, the rise in bond yields and the outflow of foreign investments could further strain fiscal resources. While the government expresses confidence in the rupee stabilizing, the overall economic environment described in the article points towards potential fiscal challenges ahead.",

The other so-called disagreements are only a smokescreen (sic),\u201d he said on microblogging site Twitter.\n\nChidambaram said, \u201cNowhere in the world is the central bank a board-managed company.

Firstly, it mentions that the fiscal deficit target for the current year has already been breached, and economists expect it to rise to 3.5% of GDP by the end of the year. Additionally, the article highlights the potential for increased government spending in 2018 due to the upcoming General Elections in 2019, which could lead to populist schemes and higher expenditures. Furthermore, the article points out that GST collections are lower than forecast, which could further strain the fiscal deficit. Rising crude oil prices and a weakening rupee are also mentioned as factors that could exacerbate the fiscal deficit.

Oil prices are close to $77. Clearly the pressure is coming from fuel and power. Along with that, the rupee is also depreciating vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar. Together, the combination is going to see a reversal of the trend.WPI had been declining for five consecutive months, since November last year. Now, we are seeing a reversal in that trend. We could see that reflected in the consumer price inflation also even though the fuel and power segment has a much lower weightage in the CPI as compared to WPI.In the wholesale price index, the fuel and power index has a weightage of close to 14% as against 9% in CPI. I do expect a reversal in the trend of CPI as well as WPI inflation numbers coming down. I expect a reversal even though the RBI does not take WPI formally into its calculations. Clearly the days of declining interest rates are over, industry must brace itself for higher interest rates.It would appear so because one does not know where they are. As we approach the general election dates, one does not know whether the government will get cold feet and go back to the era of subsidies. Remember this government has been staunch about deregulating oil prices but as the election date approaches, and particularly if BJP does not do very well in Karnataka, then you would expect the government to go in for populist measures and that would be quite damaging for the long-term prognosis for reforms. However, it might win the BJP some short-term political gains.We will have to wait and see because clearly oil prices will go up, particularly after the US has pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices going up and rupee depreciating together is not a very happy situation for India.First of all, the primary food articles really do not have much of a weight in the wholesale price index. Second, even though they have gone up marginally, the fact is that as the summer months approach, typically food prices and food inflation does look up. But as far as the WPI is concerned, the large worry really has always been fuel and power. So far, in manufactured articles, we did not see much increase in inflation and prices because there was huge under utilisation of capacity. But as the capacity gets utilised, as demand picks up and we are seeing signs of demand picking up, manufacturing inflation will also go up but not significantly.: The headline inflation is slightly firmer than consensus. As usual, for the WPI we look less at food and in this environment particularly more at what has been the impact of commodity prices. In WPI, as compared to the CPI, the weightage of crude and products is at about 10% which includes the mineral oils as well which is usually associated product.If you take out the administered prices which is usually LPG as well as kerosene, you are left at about 9 plus weightage which is significant for commodity prices and taxes which are running on top of it. So, this is a crucial time.I also want to highlight here that at the same time last year, the rupee had a weakening bias and oil prices were relatively high. So, the full impact is still not very visible in the numbers. In the next six months, the base effect will be more pronounced and particularly in the next three months when WPI as well as the CPI had actually softened a lot comparatively in last year.So, a lot of base effect is coming in. We are looking predominately at fuel in the WPI as well as manufacturing inflation. On both these counts there are indications that things are turning around. Good news for the manufacturing inflation is that pricing power is actually coming back after long haul but we have to take that with the pinch of salt/As pricing power comes back, output prices go up as do input prices in terms in terms of commodities-related sectors. It is positive to see capacity being utilised like Mythili mentioned but the pressure on margins continue because of higher input prices.So, for CPI, our forecast is 4.5%, a pinch higher than consensus but looking at the WPI it does suggest some pipeline upside risk for the retail inflation as well.: it is an important development and unfortunately, apart from supply and demand, there is also this geopolitical angle that has complicated the picture. Whether US reimposes sanctions on Iran because of pulling out of the non-nuclear treaty, adds to the worries. Iran was the third biggest supplier of crude oil and overall trade with India had also improved since 2016 when the deal was signed so it certainly does not bode well.On a micro level, Saudi Arabia as well as Iraq, the other suppliers for India have assured that the shortfall can be made up for but in the very near term because refineries were looking at setting up purchases from Iran, it looks like we will have to go back to a phase where transactions with Iran used to be more barter, more on rupee payments which is difficult to access as compared to the normal banking channel.As a house call we expect commodity prices to be at a higher $70-75 range. If FY18 was a challenging year, FY19 is likely to be the same because as the base effect gets unfavourable over the next six to eight months, we will see the impact of a weaker rupee as well as higher oil prices being much more pronounced in inflation as well as the macro numbers.At the end of this month, we have a growth numbers coming in and I think that would be strong at 7% plus levels but thereafter we will see growth settle in the 7-7.5% kind of range. In the short-term, a positive growth number will take some sting out of these macro weakness but in the longer haul, if oil prices continue to appreciate, we would see the current account deficit closer to 2.5%, the inflation settle in into the 4.5-5% from CPI and growth at the margin take a hit.Both the factors that you highlighted go hand in hand to a great extent. Petroleum subsidies used to be as big 0.5-0.6% of GDP. It has come down to 0.1% in the latest fiscal year as well as the fiscal year we are in. It is a very difficult challenging situation to be in and a true test of how deregulated market prices are really at this instance.Certainly, state elections are not going to be make it easier. My personal view would be there is likely to be a slight increase. Not much relief will come in from he excise duty cut until the government has a better visibility on the GST aspect of the revenues as well as privatisation which got off to a strong start. But with Air India hitting its own hurdles, there are still a question marks on other non-tax revenue avenues.So, the government is unlikely to go for heavy excise duty cuts though one could be forthcoming over the next couple of weeks. But after that, I do not think we would have another round of cuts until and unless we have clear visibility on the other revenue sources. Every Re 1 cut in excise duty, costs us 0.08% of GDP and this only adds to the overall fiscal burden.I do not think the government will risk taking a hit on revenues. The approaching state elections probably will see a cosmetic Rs 1-2 cut but I do not think the entire structure will be dismantled. This the true test of the reforms which were undertaken in 2014 when most of these fuel types were deregulated.",

Additionally, there is mention of limited relief from excise duty cuts due to uncertainties around GST revenues and privatization efforts. These factors collectively suggest that the fiscal deficit may increase in the future, driven by higher expenditures and potential revenue shortfalls.",

Despite these challenges, India has performed relatively well and remains below the debt level of 2002, according to the finance ministry's statement. Furthermore, the general government debt, covering both states and the Centre, has experienced a significant decline from approximately 88 percent in FY 2020-21 to around 81 percent in 2022-23, it said. The Centre remains on track to achieve its fiscal consolidation target, aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP by FY 2025-26, the finance ministry added.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article indicates that the Centre is on track to achieve its fiscal consolidation target, aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 4.5 percent of GDP by FY 2025-26. This suggests a clear intention and plan to decrease the fiscal deficit in the future. The finance ministry's statement reinforces this positive outlook by highlighting the decline in general government debt from 88 percent in FY 2020-21 to around 81 percent in 2022-23. While the IMF report mentions extreme scenarios like a potential \"100 percent of debt to GDP ratio\" under adverse shocks, the finance ministry dismisses this as a worst-case consideration and emphasizes favorable circumstances that could reduce the debt to GDP ratio below 70 percent by FY2028. Overall, the article provides a strong indication that the fiscal deficit is expected to decrease in the future.",

    "full_article": "Investors initially seemed happy on Budget day, as evinced from the Sensex soaring 486 points at the end of the Budget session. But that was mainly because the long-term capital gains tax on equity transactions was left untouched by the Finance Minister. Stock market movement in the subsequent sessions was more circumspect.\n\nThe Budget is, however, not a damp squib for Indian companies and there are various positive takeaways for investors. The focus on rural India and the agri-economy will ensure that consumption in this segment revives. Similarly, increase in government capital expenditure will translate into demand for listed companies, improving their order flows. The digital India drive is another theme that will help companies that cater to this segment.\n\nHere is a closer look at these themes.\n\nRural consumption The Budget seeks to give a boost to rural consumption by emphasising on employment generation. The highest-ever allocation to the rural employment generation scheme, MNREGA, along with the increased thrust on rural housing, road construction and electrification will ensure that there is enough money in the hands of rural consumers. There are a host of measures to help farmers get credit, insure their produce and sell their products at better prices, too.\n\nCompanies that depend on the rural economy are well placed to make the most of this thrust. Tractor manufacturers such as Mahindra & Mahindra and two-wheeler makers such as Hero MotoCorp can make the most of this demand revival once the effects of demonetisation wear off. Sales in these segments have been hit in the first two months of 2017, but things are expected to normalise in the next couple of quarters. Similarly, agri input manufacturers such as Coromandel International, GSFC and Rallis India can also see better toplines if the purchasing power of farmers improves.\n\nInfrastructure boost Capital expenditure in FY18 is budgeted to increase 10.7 per cent. The total budgetary spending of \u20b93,96,135 crore on infrastructure will have a trickle-down affect on other sectors such as cement, capital goods and steel, besides direct beneficiaries such as road construction companies, real estate companies and those supplying to the railways.\n\nThe \u20b964,900 crore budgeted for roads that include construction budgets for highways, rural and coastal roads will translate into improved order books for road construction companies such as IRB Infrastructure, Ashoka Buildcon, L&T, Sadbhav Engineering, IVRCL, MEP Infrastructure and NCC. These companies are already witnessing good order inflows due to improved execution of road projects.\n\nThe allocation of \u20b91.31 lakh crore for rail infrastructure is a positive for rail equipment manufacturers. These companies have been the beneficiaries of the Centre\u2019s thrust to improve rail infrastructure in recent years, with companies in this segment witnessing strong order book growth. It\u2019s best to keep an eye on companies such as Texmaco Rail and Engineering and Titagarh Wagons that operate in this space.\n\nMany capital goods companies will draw the benefit of increased infrastructure spends. Companies that appear attractive from this stand-point include Sanghvi Movers, Engineers India, Cummins India, Larsen & Toubro and Techno Electric.\n\nCement companies derive a large chunk of their demand from rural housing (30 per cent) and infrastructure (20 per cent). These companies stand to gain due to the increase in allocation of 39 per cent to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to \u20b929,000 crore and increased investment in infrastructure that consumes cement, amounting to a total of \u20b94.2 lakh crore. Cement companies that appear well placed to take advantage of this demand include UltraTech Cement and Ambuja Cement.\n\nReal estate companies are down in the dumps due to large unsold inventory and sluggish demand. But companies in the listed space that cater to affordable housing such as Mahindra Lifespace Developers and Godrej Properties can benefit from the impetus given to affordable housing.\n\nAffordable housing is now to be accorded infrastructure status, thus making it easier for the developers to raise funding.\n\nDigital India The Budget contains various proposals to give a push to the Digital India programme. Full exemption from customs duty has been given to makers of POS machines, scanners, fingerprint readers, iris scanners and micro-ATMs. TVS Electronics, which sells POS products and scanners, stands to gain.\n\nThe push to increase digital payments will benefit RS Software, which built the UPI platform and is also a partner in the Bharat Bill Payment System. Large IT players, including Infosys and TCS, will also see orders flowing from this drive.\n\nOther sector gainers The reduction in customs duty on liquefied natural gas (LNG) to 2.5 per cent from 5 per cent will increase the demand for natural gas. This is a positive for many listed companies, including importers such as Petronet LNG, transmitters such as GAIL (India), city gas distributors such as Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas. The proposed integrated public sector \u2018oil major\u2019 appears a good idea as it will create a company large enough to take on large international companies operating in this space. But this could take some time to fructify.\n\nA lot of air-time was allotted to education in the FM\u2019s speech. There are some listed companies in the education space such as Career Point Education and NIIT that could get a push on account of this.\n\nBesides the themes discussed above, there are a couple of areas that impact listed companies that investors need to take note of.\n\nCorporate tax tweak The Finance Minister disappointed India Inc by selectively reducing corporate tax rate only for companies with annual turnover of less that \u20b950 crore, from 30 to 25 per cent. Almost all the listed companies will be out of the ambit of this reduction.\n\nAccording to capitaline, 2,187 companies had turnover less than \u20b950 crore as on March 2016. But of these, 457 have no turnover at all and 1,086 recorded turnover less than \u20b92 crore.\n\nAlmost half the companies recorded losses and some of them such as ABG Shipyard, Everonn Education, KS Oil and Agro Dutch Industries have run up fairly large losses. So there are hardly any fundamentally-sound listed company with annual turnover under \u20b950 crore. However, firms listed on the SME platforms of BSE and NSE need another dekko after this tax change.\n\nThe minimum alternate tax was not altered, but the FM has allowed the MAT credit to be carried forward for 15 years instead of the 10 years. This change will help companies that have large MAT credits that need to be set off.\n\nThere are some losers due to the FM\u2019s inaction too. SEZ developers, infrastructure and cement companies (Gujarat Pipavav Ports, IRB Infrastructure Developers, The Ramco Cement, India Cements), having units in specified locations in the north-east, and exporters (located in SEZs) will not have any relief as they will continue to pay a basic tax rate of 18.5 per cent under MAT.\n\nInterest payment on foreign debt Another provision that needs a closer look by investors is the restriction on the interest payment made on Indian companies to an associated company overseas. This change seeks to address the issue of \u2018thin capitalisation\u2019 wherein companies have more debt than capital.\n\nThe FM has stated that if such interest payments exceed \u20b91 crore, it should be 30 per cent of the company\u2019s EBIDTA or the actual interest paid, whichever is less. Also, if the lender of the debt to the Indian company is not an associated company or entity, but an associated entity has given a guarantee to the lender, such debt transaction shall also fall within the purview of this provision.\n\nThis provision could hurt subsidiaries of multi-national companies that are running their operations with debt taken from their parent or other group entities.\n\nSince this is a part of the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (BEPS) initiative, it is probably aimed at stemming movement of taxable profit out of India in the form of interest.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights several government spending initiatives, including increased allocations for rural employment, infrastructure, and the Digital India program. These measures suggest a significant rise in government expenditure, particularly in capital expenditure, which is budgeted to increase by 10.7% in FY18. Additionally, the focus on rural development, affordable housing, and infrastructure projects implies sustained or higher spending in these areas. While there is no explicit mention of tax revenue projections or fiscal reforms that could offset this spending, the emphasis on increased government expenditure without corresponding revenue-raising measures suggests a potential rise in the fiscal deficit. The article does not provide any indication that the deficit will decrease or be controlled, making the outlook for future fiscal deficit somewhat negative.",

The Indian government would do well to remember this maxim as it tries to stitch together a fiscal response to the Covid-19 crisis within the constraints of the Union Budget it had presented in February. Governments around the world have made it amply clear while rolling out mega-stimulus packages, that normal budgetary considerations go out of the window in these extra-ordinary times. The Centre too, must recognise that none of the estimates it made on February 1 can be expected to stick to the script now. Though the Parliament has already passed the Budget, it would be best to acknowledge that the crisis calls for an urgent re-assessment of Central priorities and to completely redraw it.\n\nThere are three sets of Budget assumptions that call for a serious relook. One, with the Covid-19 crisis likely to sharply dent India\u2019s GDP growth this quarter onwards, the ambitious tax revenue growth assumed in the revised estimates for FY20 are now highly unlikely to be met. This will also affect assumptions for FY21, which factor in a 9 per cent increase in taxes and a 11 per increase in non-tax revenues on the high base. With the nationwide lockdown freezing economic activity, the next couple of quarters are likely to be a complete washout for most businesses, making it imperative for the Centre to come up with financial support to ensure business continuity. Two, the standard outlays in the February Budget towards administrative costs, defence expenditure and pet schemes need to be revisited too. As lakhs of displaced migrant workers struggle to make ends meet, they urgently require some form of direct cash support to meet their basic needs. None of the measures announced in the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana \u2014 higher rations, small credits into women\u2019s Jan Dhan accounts, higher MGNREGA wages, EPF withdrawals \u2014 address the problems of these informal workers. The size of this package \u2014 at 0.8 per cent of GDP \u2014 mocks the scale of this problem. Three, research agencies are now modelling alarming numbers on the need for hospital beds and critical care equipment should Covid-19 spread. This has underlined the glaring inadequacy of India\u2019s public health infrastructure in terms of both the number of doctors and beds and equipment, which will need investments on a war footing over the next few months.

    "deficit_analysis": "ANALYSIS: The article provides mixed signals about the future fiscal deficit direction. On the negative side, it highlights that the government's spending bill is expected to rise by almost \u20b92 lakh crore this fiscal year due to higher allocations for subsidies, which could stretch the fiscal deficit. Additionally, there are concerns about a shortfall in receipts from the sale of stakes in state-run firms. On the positive side, rising tax collections, particularly from goods and services tax (GST), driven by increased urban demand and higher inflation, could help meet the budgeted fiscal deficit target. The government has set a fiscal deficit target of 6.4% of GDP for 2022/23, which is lower than the previous year's 6.7%, indicating an intention to reduce the deficit. However, the overall spending is still increasing, albeit at a slower rate in real terms due to inflation. The article does not provide a clear, definitive prediction of the future fiscal deficit direction, but the potential",

    "full_article": "Everyone agrees that fixing the banks is critical for reversing the current slowdown, and returning to healthy growth in the medium term. But a credible solution has yet to be outlined. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Viral Acharya hit the nail on the head when he said Indradhanush, the banking reforms programme announced two years ago, is not enough and we should look for a Sudarshan Chakra instead. The imagery is apt. Indradhanush is not the weapon of Lord Indra. It is only the Hindi word for \u201crainbow\u201d, which is an ephemeral phenomenon, disappearing as suddenly as it appears. Sudarshan Chakra, on the other hand, is Lord Vishnu\u2019s weapon, which, once released, unerringly chops off whatever heads it was meant to chop off, and then returns to the sender.\n\nSo what would a Sudarshan Chakra for fixing the banks look like? Let us consider the four \u201cR\u201ds which are said to be the key to solving the problems of the banks: recognition, resolution, recapitalization, and reform.\n\nRecognition\n\nThere is progress here. The RBI\u2019s asset quality review has revealed that the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio of both public and private sector banks is higher than was earlier thought, but in the PSU (public sector undertaking) banks, it is alarming at about 12%. And this is an underestimate, because it does not include assets that are \u201cstressed\u201d but not yet NPAs. The market assessment is that when these chickens come home to roost, the NPA percentage may increase by up to 6%.\n\nResolution of problem loans\n\nThe Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is a major reform with some Sudarshan Chakra like qualities. Once an account is referred by a creditor under the IBC to the National Company Law Tribunal, and is admitted, the powers of the management and the board are transferred to an independent insolvency professional (IP). The IP then looks for someone willing to take over the project on suitable terms, including a write-down of the debt. The extent of the debt write-down needed will vary from project to project.\n\nIf the IP succeeds in finding an investor willing to take over the project with a sufficient reduction of debt, and the creditors accept the debt reduction, then the new management takes over. If no one is willing to take over, or the banks don\u2019t accept the debt reduction implied by the package, the company is simply liquidated. The law prescribes that the process must be completed within 180 days, extendable by another 90 days at most. If there is no resolution within this period, liquidation must take place.\n\nThe process changes the incentive structure facing bank managements by giving them a legally sanctified method of determining what is a reasonable haircut. Since the alternative is liquidation, they should be willing to accept any haircut that gives them more than they would get from liquidation. Hopefully, the process will free managements from having to worry about the Central Bureau of Investigation/the Central Vigilance Commission/the Comptroller and Auditor General, which otherwise discourage decision making.\n\nIn June, the RBI directed the banks to file insolvency applications for 12 large accounts that had defaulted on payments. The time table set by the law implies that these accounts must be resolved or the companies liquidated by April 2018 at the latest. It is not certain that new investors can be found willing to take over all these projects; so some liquidations may well take place. This is actually good from the system\u2019s point of view, since it will set precedents about realizable values in the event of a liquidation and the variation in these values across projects.\n\nThe RBI has also identified another 29 which the banks must first try to \u201cresolve\u201d by mid-December, and file insolvency petitions thereafter if no resolution is possible. Whether the banks will be able to resolve some of these cases will depend on whether they are willing to reduce the outstanding debt in favour of the existing management based on a negotiation process. They may be reluctant to do so for fear they may be criticized for favouring undeserving managements . In that case, we will have another 29 cases going down the IBC route by mid-December, with a final conclusion in October 2018.\n\nThe process will certainly clean up the books of the banks over the next 12 months or so, but it will also mean acceptance of large losses and a corresponding depletion of capital. It is impossible to judge what the scale of losses will be. The Synergies Dooray Automotive Ltd case, the first to emerge from the IBC process, ended up with a haircut of 94%! But that was an old case, which had been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction in 2005. The cases now being referred may be better, but even so, market expectations are that haircuts of 60% or more may be necessary to attract new investors. This will clearly lead to a considerable erosion of capital.\n\nRecapitalization\n\nThis brings us to the third \u201cR\u201d i.e., recapitalization. In 2015, the finance ministry had estimated that the PSU banks needed \u20b9 .4 trillion of capital, of which \u20b9 .1 trillion was to come from the market, \u20b9 0,000 crore from retained profits, and the remaining \u20b9 70,000 crore from the budget. The budget provision was duly made, and under the existing Indradhanush programme, only \u20b9 0,000 crore is due this year and the same amount next year. This is clearly insufficient because the NPA situation has turned out to be much worse than expected.\n\nFitch Ratings has estimated that Indian PSU banks will need as much as Rs4 trillion of capital by end of March 2019 to meet the capital requirements under Basel III. Other estimates put the need even higher. If Fitch\u2019s estimates are correct, the finance ministry faces a major problem. The problem is worsened by the fact that there are pressures on the budget for fiscal stimulus to counter the current slowdown.\n\nThe scope for using public funds to recapitalize the PSU banks can only be judged on the basis of a holistic view of the many other demands for government expenditure. We cannot keep talking of stimulating the economy through increased government expenditure, without a clear view of how much of the capital requirement of the PSU banks has to be met from the budget.\n\nReforms\n\nThis brings us to the last of the four \u201cR\u201ds. Reforms in PSU banks are expected to make the banks more efficient and the need for reform is therefore independent of whether public resources are being used to recapitalize them. However, the compulsion to undertake reforms is greater if the budget is being saddled with a huge burden.\n\nWhat sort of reforms do we need? Some of what is being called reform, e.g., the idea of merging public sector banks, is not reform at all. Merging strong banks with other banks will do nothing to improve the average balance sheet, and will saddle the merged entity with innumerable personnel problems related to establishing equivalence across different bank cadres. What we need are reforms that improve governance, upgrade the skill set, and improve the quality of risk assessment within the PSU banks.\n\nThe most important reform will be to reduce the government\u2019s equity to 33% in selected PSU banks. This would allow the stronger PSU banks to raise additional capital from the market, including from possible strategic investors, who could be offered seats on the board. The inclusion of strategic investors, with representation on the board, may make it easier to raise capital without burdening the budget.\n\nThe proposal to reduce government equity to 33% is not new. It was first made 20 years ago in 1998 by the Narasimham II Committee set up by United Front government. Yashwant Sinha as the finance minister of the Vajpayee government had even intended to do it in 1999, but the government baulked at that time. There may be political opposition from many parties even today, but as in the case of the goods and services tax, you never know when the system is ready for a consensus.\n\nWith a 33% equity share, the government would still have a controlling position in the board, but the banks would become board-managed companies and the board, including representatives of the strategic investors, would take all the critical decisions, especially regarding the appointment of top management. These banks will no longer be subject to micro management by the department of financial services. Anyone who thinks that active involvement by the finance ministry helps the quality of credit decisions has to be reminded that the NPAs have been built up despite the finance ministry, and even the RBI, being represented on the boards of the banks.\n\nFinally, if the budget is under stress, all public sector banks need not be recapitalized to ensure targeted growth in lending. Weak banks that have eroded their capital very substantially should be subjected to the RBI\u2019s \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d discipline, which limits new commercial lending until their capital position improves. This will allow healthier banks, both private and public, and also more nimble non-bank financial companies, to expand and occupy the lending space created.\n\nEven with these reforms, the scale of the capital injection needed may lead to the fiscal deficit limit being exceeded. However, if this is at least accompanied by serious reforms, such as reducing government equity below 33%, we have a better chance of being viewed positively by international analysts and opinion makers.\n\nTo summarize, the scale of the problem is much larger than was thought and the downturn in the economy has also made the need for corrective measures more urgent. We do need a Sudarshan Chakra on reforms. Merely dressing up Indradhanush will not do.",

Finally, if the budget is under stress, all public sector banks need not be recapitalized to ensure targeted growth in lending. Weak banks that have eroded their capital very substantially should be subjected to the RBI\u2019s \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d discipline, which limits new commercial lending until their capital position improves. This will allow healthier banks, both private and public, and also more nimble non-bank financial companies, to expand and occupy the lending space created. Even with these reforms, the scale of the capital injection needed may lead to the fiscal deficit limit being exceeded. However, if this is at least accompanied by serious reforms, such as reducing government equity below 33%, we have a better chance of being viewed positively by international analysts and opinion makers. To summarize, the scale of the problem is much larger than was thought and the downturn in the economy has also made the need for corrective measures more urgent. We do need a Sudarshan Chakra on reforms. Merely dressing up Indradhanush will not do.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article highlights significant challenges in the Indian banking sector, particularly the need for recapitalization of public sector banks (PSBs) to address non-performing assets (NPAs) and meet Basel III requirements. Fitch Ratings estimates a capital requirement of Rs4 trillion by March 2019, which is much higher than previous government projections. This suggests a substantial fiscal burden, as the government may need to allocate significant funds from the budget to recapitalize these banks. Additionally, the article mentions pressures on the budget for fiscal stimulus to counter the economic slowdown, further straining fiscal resources. While reforms like reducing government equity in PSBs could alleviate some fiscal pressure, the article explicitly states that the scale of capital injection needed may lead to the fiscal deficit limit being exceeded. This indicates a clear risk of an increasing fiscal deficit in the future.  \n\n**",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests that the Indian government is likely to adopt a pro-growth stance in the upcoming Union Budget 2021-22, with the Finance Minister indicating that \"fiscal deficit fears will not derail government spending.\" This implies a continuation or even an increase in government spending to address public health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure needs, as well as to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article also highlights the need for fiscal stimulus to support economic recovery, particularly in the context of sluggish private consumption and plummeting private corporate investment. While the government acknowledges the constraints of fiscal space, the emphasis on sustained policy support and the potential for flexible fiscal rules suggests that the fiscal deficit is likely to increase in the near future. The comparison with other countries' fiscal stimulus measures further underscores the likelihood of increased government spending, which would contribute to a higher fiscal deficit.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article discusses a proposed acquisition by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) of REC, which could have implications for the government's fiscal deficit. The government's fiscal deficit has already exceeded its FY19 budget estimate due to muted tax revenues and lower-than-targeted disinvestment proceeds. The acquisition, if approved, could potentially impact the government's disinvestment targets and fiscal position. However, the article does not provide a clear prediction about the future direction of the fiscal deficit. It mentions concerns about the net worth of the acquiring company and potential value disruption in the power and renewable energy sectors, but these do not directly translate into a clear fiscal deficit prediction. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear indication of whether the fiscal deficit will increase, decrease, or remain the same in the future.",

We started already in a bad way with the series of shocks they had been subjected to before the pandemic. With the pandemic, a significant portion will not survive. In India, where there are no supports, that is a serious loss to the economic muscle,\u201d he said.Rajan termed as \u201cthoroughly disappointing\u201d an article on Tuesday written by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the government\u2019s economic reforms.\u201cI read the FM's piece, I do not know when it was written but it was thoroughly disappointing in what it talks about.

We are still talking about universal transfers because we cannot target given that Jan Dhan does not really work as advertised,\u201d he said.With reference to a mention in the article of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s two-day Gyan Sangam in 2015 with public sector banks on banking reforms and addressing NPAs, Rajan said, \u201cOn bank reforms, she talks about how wonderful the Gyan Sangam has been. The level of NPAs is going to be unprecedented six months from now, if we really recognise the true level of NPAs.\u201dRajan questioned the suspension of proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. \u201cThe only measure for dealing with this is the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) which we have suspended for new cases. How are we going to deal with the huge mounting bad loans in the financial sector?\u201dPrachi Mishra, the chief India economist at Goldman Sachs, concurred with Rajan on ratings. Ratings firms and markets do not expect fiscal consolidation, but a growth revival strategy and a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan from the government, she said.According to Mishra, the second quarter also saw a weak economic performance with a 45% quarter-on-quarter contraction on an annualised rate. The expected pick up in the next quarter was bringing in a sense of complacency among policymakers and market players, she said.\"Going into the third quarter, of course, there is going to be a pickup. People are getting excited about this pickup but this is almost mechanical. If you have a quarter with a very sharp contraction, the following quarter is almost mechanically going to pick up,\u201d Mishra said.",

We are still talking about universal transfers because we cannot target given that Jan Dhan does not really work as advertised,\u201d he said.With reference to a mention in the article of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s two-day Gyan Sangam in 2015 with public sector banks on banking reforms and addressing NPAs, Rajan said, \u201cOn bank reforms, she talks about how wonderful the Gyan Sangam has been. The level of NPAs is going to be unprecedented six months from now, if we really recognise the true level of NPAs.\u201dRajan questioned the suspension of proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. \u201cThe only measure for dealing with this is the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) which we have suspended for new cases. How are we going to deal with the huge mounting bad loans in the financial sector?\u201dPrachi Mishra, the chief India economist at Goldman Sachs, concurred with Rajan on ratings. Ratings firms and markets do not expect fiscal consolidation, but a growth revival strategy and a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan from the government, she said.According to Mishra, the second quarter also saw a weak economic performance with a 45% quarter-on-quarter contraction on an annualised rate. The expected pick up in the next quarter was bringing in a sense of complacency among policymakers and market players, she said.\"Going into the third quarter, of course, there is going to be a pickup. People are getting excited about this pickup but this is almost mechanical. If you have a quarter with a very sharp contraction, the following quarter is almost mechanically going to pick up,\u201d Mishra said.",

    "deficit_analysis": "**  \nThe article suggests that the government is prioritizing growth revival over fiscal consolidation, with former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan emphasizing the need for increased spending to repair economic damage caused by the pandemic. This implies a potential rise in government expenditure, particularly to support struggling MSMEs and address non-performing assets (NPAs) in the financial sector. Additionally, the suspension of proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the anticipated surge in NPAs could further strain fiscal resources. While there is no explicit mention of tax revenue projections or specific spending plans, the focus on growth revival and the acknowledgment of weak economic performance in the second quarter suggest that fiscal pressures may persist. The article also highlights that credit rating agencies and markets do not expect fiscal consolidation, reinforcing the likelihood of a widening fiscal deficit in the near future.  \n\n**",

Therefore, in an environment where interest rates in the US are rising, other emerging markets will be much more in the firing line. In an interview to ET, Chinoy said the true quantum of India\u2019s growth recovery should be assessed only after the favourable base effects of the next few quarters wear off. He sees higher oil and commodity prices as the biggest risk as they will impact inflation, the current account deficit, corporate margins and the fiscal deficit Edited excerpts:People sometimes don\u2019t realise that India\u2019s GDP slowdown started well before demonetisation as the positive terms of trade shock from oil faded and the deleveraging took hold. The economy has clearly bottomed, and that is visible in a number of high-frequency indicators. That said, GDP growth in the coming quarters will also accelerate because of very favourable base effects. We, therefore, need to look through those and assess growth after the base effects wear off. With global growth strong, the hope is India\u2019s exports will accelerate on a more consistent basis. In contrast, rising oil prices remain a key headwind to growth. Net exports have been a large drag on growth in recent quarters. The hope is this will reverse going forward.India\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond yields have sold off by more than 65 bps over the last three months, more than twice the increase in the US. This is particularly surprising because liquidity is still in surplus and credit growth is still soft.The key here is that the quantum of borrowing by the Centre and states \u2014 along with the OMO sales that the RBI has had to engage in this year to sterilise its foreign exchange purchases \u2014 has exhausted the absorptive capacity of the market. This year, for example, total supply (Centre, states and OMO sales) is almost \u20b92 lakh crore higher than last year. In turn, this has pushed up the underlying term/risk premium \u2014 which had been masked by the curve pricing in some monetary easing.The Centre\u2019s borrowing has gradually been coming down, but state borrowing has more than doubled over the last four years. High benchmark yields both impede transmission into the corporate bond market and imperil debt dynamics.Given the signals from the bondmarket, it\u2019s important that there is no adverse fiscal surprise, and if this year\u2019s central deficit target is relaxed, it is compensated by a commitment to deficit reduction in the future. Furthermore, if oil prices go up further, it\u2019s important that these be passed on to consumers rather than absorbed by the fiscal. Not only will this take the pressure off the fiscal, but it will invoke a volume response by households and firms that should mitigate the price impact, and therefore offset the impact on the current account deficit.State deficits in the last 4-5 years have widened by almost 1% of GDP and undone the Centre\u2019s consolidation. Furthermore, under the 14th Finance Commission, prudent states can go to 3.25% and 3.5%. What this means is, on a weighted average basis, states still have space to expand their deficit by another 0.5-0.6% of GDP. The key is to change the incentives under which states operate. Both prudent and profligate states face the same market borrowing costs. And there are no incentives \u2014 from a Finance Commission perspective to reduce the deficit below 3%. I hope the Fifteenth Finance Commission will address this.As long as the CAD is in the 2-2.5% range, the balance of payments will be fine. Plus, we have $400 billion of forex reserves. Therefore, India \u2014 along with Indonesia \u2014 is still considered a safe haven in the emerging market universe. Investors often say that in the event of global shocks, they would like to \u201chide in India\u201d. That\u2019s why we have seen so much of debt-inflows in 2017. Global investors are banking on the fact that macroeconomic stability is progressively being institutionalised in India. We should do nothing to challenge that perception.Some of recent acceleration in credit growth is the manifestation of a favourable base effect. There is no convincing evidence yet that we are about to embark on a capex cycle. That will have to wait till the resolution/recapitalisation is taken to its logical conclusion.The government must be lauded for taking the bull by its horns, both on account of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the amendment and the bank recapitalisation. But more resources will eventually be needed. If the haircut required on the existing stock of NPAs is 50%, then the government\u2019s package will be sufficient. But if that is simply increased to 60%, significantly higher resources will be needed. Furthermore, this is resolution capital. You will additionally need growth capital. And, precisely because so much of public monies will be committed, it\u2019s important that adequate reforms accompany the recapitalisation.If done correctly, however, and nominal GDP growth were to pickup by just 0.5% in the coming years on account of this, the whole package will pay for itself from a debt dynamics perspective.In this global environment, with so much residual excess capacity, attracting manufacturing investment is a challenge. India\u2019s opportunity has to be in the infrastructure sector. That, itself, can drive investment cycle for a decade. Take affordable housing , for example. The constraint is not money, but margins are so narrow that if there is a delay of 6-12 months in urban areas, the project becomes unviable. So if authorities were to streamline implementation, and mitigate the upstream regulatory risk (land acquisition, clearances etc), the sector could see a lot of interest and buoyancy. And the spillovers from housing are substantial. In this global environment, policymakers would need to be very opportunistic to jumpstart investment in different sectors.G-Sec yields have sold off a lot in recent months, but, equally, the spread between corporate bonds and G-Secs has come down a lot. A lot of money has flowed into mutual funds after demonetisation and they prefer to invest in corporate bonds for the yield mark-up.Also, there has been a lot of foreign inflows into the corporate bond market after G-Sec limits got full. So the spread has compressed meaningfully in the last few months. But some of the spread compression has been offset by the hardening of underlying G-Sec yields. So we need to address the demand-supply imbalance in the GSec market, by keeping supply contained, to ensure that corporate bond yields witness monetary transmission, particularly given the growing reliance on the corporate bond market, as banks work through their deleveraging.In this environment, I believe so. December inflation is on track to being much higher than 5% and if oil remains at these levels between January-March, it could well average close to 5%. More saliently, core inflation momentum has firmed for the last three months. The good news is that might be signalling some pricing power and suggestive that demand is seeing some firming. All told, we expect headline CPI to average between 4.5-5% in 2018 and that should keep the Reserve Bank of India on hold.With the US very close to full employment and policymakers there engaging in a late-cycle fiscal stimulus, there is growing conviction that the Fed will be forced to raise rates four times next year, even as the FOMC \u201cdots\u201d have not converged to that level yet.The key, however, is productivity growth. Only if productivity growth lifts further, can one reconcile stronger headline GDP growth and reduced pressures on resource utilisation. Yes, productivity growth has lifted the last few quarters as business capex has picked up, but thus far, in Q4 2017 it is tracking 0%.More generally, if you go back to all the US business cycles over the last century, second half productivity growth is much less than in the first half, for understandable reasons.So we are up against the law of gravity. Which is why, if US growth hold up, there is more conviction of four rate hikes in 2018. Bond markets don\u2019t believe that as yet, and that suggests some mispricing in global bond markets. More generally, global unemployment rates are very close to the lows of the last cycle, yet policy rates are 200 bps below where they were at this time in the last cycle. Something will have to give.Against this backdrop, India must be careful not to trade off macroeconomic stability for higher growth.",

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: ANALYSIS: The article highlights several factors that could influence India's future fiscal deficit. Rising oil and commodity prices are identified as significant risks, which could increase inflation, widen the current account deficit, and pressure the fiscal deficit. The article also mentions that state deficits have widened in recent years, undoing some of the central government's fiscal consolidation efforts. While the central government's borrowing has been decreasing, state borrowing has more than doubled, contributing to higher benchmark yields and potential fiscal risks. Additionally, the article suggests that if oil prices rise further, passing these costs to consumers rather than absorbing them fiscally could mitigate pressure on the deficit. However, there is no clear commitment to deficit reduction, and the possibility of relaxed central deficit targets introduces uncertainty. The article also notes the need for additional resources for bank recapitalization and growth capital, which could further strain fiscal resources. Overall, the article hints at potential fiscal challenges and risks of a widening deficit, though it does not provide a definitive prediction.",

Foreign brokerages see Sensex breach 86,000 points by end of 2024\n\nTop overseas brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays are upbeat on Indian stock markets in 2024 although geopolitical developments, crude oil prices, and central bank policies may sway investor sentiment. Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish scenario sees Sensex at 86,000 points by the end of 2024, Goldman Sachs predicts Nifty to reach 21,800 points by the end of next year.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Indian equities have shown remarkable resilience in 2023, with benchmark gauges rising by around 8 percent so far. The outlook seems bright for the next year, although the general elections in summer may add some volatility.\n\n2. Active IPO market in India fails to enthuse cautious financiers with deep pockets\n\nIndia\u2019s IPO is expected to heat up this with five issues worth Rs 7,400 crore opening for subscription, but enthusiasm is muted among finance companies that have traditionally lent to bidders in such share sales. In November so far, NBFCs have raised Rs 3,500 crore through commercial papers, bringing the total borrowing through this route for the year to Rs 20,100 crore, according to Icra. In 2022, NBFCs raised Rs 45,740 crore through the instrument and raised Rs 7.1 lakh crore inn 2021, the rater said.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Since the central bank and the market regulator have placed stringent rules on IPO financing, deep-pocketed financiers are keeping market borrowings at a bare minimum.\n\n3. Smaller enterprises outshine bigger peers in past year on initial listing gains\n\nThe IPOs of small and medium firms have outperformed mainboard companies in listing gains and returns over the past year. They have listed with a median gain of 12.1 percent on their offer price compared with 8 percent for mainboard IPOs. Their median annualized returns since listing is 61 percent, higher than the 52 percent for IPOs of big enterprises.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Relatively lower free floats caused a surge in prices when demand was much higher than supply in a structural bull market. Investors should be cautious though in taking informed decisions while buying into IPOs of smaller companies.\n\n4. Profit share of Indian corporates close to breaching 5 percent of country\u2019s GDP\n\nThe net profit of Indian companies as a percentage of the country\u2019s GDP is just shy of reaching 5 percent, boosted by strong earnings growth in the second quarter of 2023-24. Projections are suggesting that this could exceed 8 percent within the next five years. In the medium to long term, analysts expect a more widespread contribution to India Inc\u2019s profit pool growth.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: There is every indication that a upcycle in corporate profits is in progress, which is driving bullish expectations of earnings growth.\n\n5. Jio Financial looks to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore in first bonds issue\n\nMukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio Financial Services is in initial talks with merchant bankers for its inaugural bond issuance that could be between Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore through five-year bonds, which could take place in the three months to March. The NBFC is currently undergoing a credit-rating process and obtaining necessary approvals.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The demerged financial arm of Reliance Industries aims to become a full-service financial services firm. It would likely lead to a fresh scramble for market dominance in the sector with lucrative offers.\n\n6. Market regulator moves court over tribunal order in Diageo\u2019s United Spirits buy\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India has moved the Supreme Court, challenging an appeals court verdict in UK alcoholic beverage maker Diageo\u2019s 2012 acquisition of United Spirits. A verdict will decide whether shareholders who exited United Spirits through an open offer in late 2012 and early 2013, when Diageo took over the company, deserved a better price.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: The outcome of the legal challenge may determine the market regulator\u2019s power to intervene in a takeover even after the open offer has concluded. This could have long-tern repercussions.\n\n7. Commercial vehicle makers expect record sales in the year to March on demand rebound\n\nSales of commercial vehicles are expected to hit a record in 2023-24, fetching robust revenue for companies like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and VE Commercial Vehicles. Pricier heavy-duty vehicles are driving demand amid record government spending on infrastructure and increased freight movement. Sales in the current financial year may marginally surpass the previous peak of 1,007,311 units in 2018-19, but revenue may rise some 30 percent from that pre-pandemic year.\n\nWhy it\u2019s important: Sales of commercial vehicles is a barometer of economic activity.

    "cleaned_article": "Morning Scan 1. Foreign brokerages see Sensex breach 86,000 points by end of 2024 Top overseas brokerages like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays are upbeat on Indian stock markets in 2024 although geopolitical developments, crude oil prices, and central bank policies may sway investor sentiment. Morgan Stanley\u2019s bullish scenario sees Sensex at 86,000 points by the end of 2024, Goldman Sachs predicts Nifty to reach 21,800 points by the end of next year. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Why it\u2019s important: Indian equities have shown remarkable resilience in 2023, with benchmark gauges rising by around 8 percent so far. The outlook seems bright for the next year, although the general elections in summer may add some volatility. 2. Active IPO market in India fails to enthuse cautious financiers with deep pockets India\u2019s IPO is expected to heat up this with five issues worth Rs 7,400 crore opening for subscription, but enthusiasm is muted among finance companies that have traditionally lent to bidders in such share sales. In November so far, NBFCs have raised Rs 3,500 crore through commercial papers, bringing the total borrowing through this route for the year to Rs 20,100 crore, according to Icra. In 2022, NBFCs raised Rs 45,740 crore through the instrument and raised Rs 7.1 lakh crore inn 2021, the rater said. Why it\u2019s important: Since the central bank and the market regulator have placed stringent rules on IPO financing, deep-pocketed financiers are keeping market borrowings at a bare minimum. 3. Smaller enterprises outshine bigger peers in past year on initial listing gains The IPOs of small and medium firms have outperformed mainboard companies in listing gains and returns over the past year. They have listed with a median gain of 12.1 percent on their offer price compared with 8 percent for mainboard IPOs. Their median annualized returns since listing is 61 percent, higher than the 52 percent for IPOs of big enterprises. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Why it\u2019s important: Relatively lower free floats caused a surge in prices when demand was much higher than supply in a structural bull market. Investors should be cautious though in taking informed decisions while buying into IPOs of smaller companies. 4. Profit share of Indian corporates close to breaching 5 percent of country\u2019s GDP The net profit of Indian companies as a percentage of the country\u2019s GDP is just shy of reaching 5 percent, boosted by strong earnings growth in the second quarter of 2023-24. Projections are suggesting that this could exceed 8 percent within the next five years. In the medium to long term, analysts expect a more widespread contribution to India Inc\u2019s profit pool growth. Why it\u2019s important: There is every indication that a upcycle in corporate profits is in progress, which is driving bullish expectations of earnings growth. 5. Jio Financial looks to raise up to Rs 10,000 crore in first bonds issue Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Jio Financial Services is in initial talks with merchant bankers for its inaugural bond issuance that could be between Rs 5,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore through five-year bonds, which could take place in the three months to March. The NBFC is currently undergoing a credit-rating process and obtaining necessary approvals. Why it\u2019s important: The demerged financial arm of Reliance Industries aims to become a full-service financial services firm. It would likely lead to a fresh scramble for market dominance in the sector with lucrative offers. 6. Market regulator moves court over tribunal order in Diageo\u2019s United Spirits buy The Securities and Exchange Board of India has moved the Supreme Court, challenging an appeals court verdict in UK alcoholic beverage maker Diageo\u2019s 2012 acquisition of United Spirits. A verdict will decide whether shareholders who exited United Spirits through an open offer in late 2012 and early 2013, when Diageo took over the company, deserved a better price. Why it\u2019s important: The outcome of the legal challenge may determine the market regulator\u2019s power to intervene in a takeover even after the open offer has concluded. This could have long-tern repercussions. 7. Commercial vehicle makers expect record sales in the year to March on demand rebound Sales of commercial vehicles are expected to hit a record in 2023-24, fetching robust revenue for companies like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, and VE Commercial Vehicles. Pricier heavy-duty vehicles are driving demand amid record government spending on infrastructure and increased freight movement. Sales in the current financial year may marginally surpass the previous peak of 1,007,311 units in 2018-19, but revenue may rise some 30 percent from that pre-pandemic year. Why it\u2019s important: Sales of commercial vehicles is a barometer of economic activity. Business expansion has been slow till now as stringent emission norms made heavy-duty vehicles costlier but there is now increased demand for lorries with higher payloads. 8. Public capital spending to rise significantly in the year ahead of national elections India\u2019s public capex spending is expected to continue even as some departments look poised to exhaust their budgets. The government may be able to meet its record capex targets as well as the fiscal deficit target in an election year, encouraged by record tax collections for the year so far.

However, it mentions that public capital spending is expected to rise significantly in the year ahead of national elections, and the government may meet its record capex targets as well as the fiscal deficit target due to robust tax collections. While increased public spending could pressure the deficit, the article suggests that strong revenue collection might offset this, allowing the government to meet its fiscal deficit target. There is no clear indication that the deficit will increase significantly, nor is there a strong suggestion of a significant decrease. The overall tone leans toward fiscal discipline being maintained despite higher spending.  \n\n**",

The RBI in its third bi-monthly monetary policy stressed on reinvigorating private investment, removing infrastructure bottlenecks and giving a major thrust to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for housing for all.\n\n\u201cThis hinges on speedier clearance of projects by the states. On their part, the government and the RBI are working in close coordination to resolve large stressed corporate borrowers and recapitalise public sector banks within the fiscal deficit target. These efforts should help restart credit flows to the productive sectors as demand revives,\u201d RBI said.\n\nEY India chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava said transmission of rate cut may be limited due to existence of excess liquidity and lack of private investment demand.

Yes Bank MD and CEO Rana Kapoor said: \u201cIndia\u2019s inflation has undergone a structural shift, with the emergence of \u2018new normal\u2019 at lower levels. \u201cThis reinforces my view of room for incremental rate cuts to the tune of 50-75 bps (or 0.5-0.75%) in coming months, which will reinforce RBI\u2019s parallel efforts to address the twin balance sheet problem and support growth recovery.\u201d Retail inflation\u2014one of the key inputs to decide repo action\u2014was at six-year low of 1.54% in June. Dena Bank CMD Ashwani Kumar said the rate cut will help banks in expanding transmission which will provide impetus to \u201ccredit growth\u201d. The RBI in its third bi-monthly monetary policy stressed on reinvigorating private investment, removing infrastructure bottlenecks and giving a major thrust to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for housing for all. \u201cThis hinges on speedier clearance of projects by the states. On their part, the government and the RBI are working in close coordination to resolve large stressed corporate borrowers and recapitalise public sector banks within the fiscal deficit target. These efforts should help restart credit flows to the productive sectors as demand revives,\u201d RBI said. EY India chief policy advisor D.K. Srivastava said transmission of rate cut may be limited due to existence of excess liquidity and lack of private investment demand. Ratings firm Crisil said, \u201cDespite a rate cut, the MPC\u2019s policy stance has been kept neutral given the expected uptick in inflation.\u201d \u201cWe do not expect any further reduction in the repo rate this fiscal,\u201d Crisil added. ICRA MD & Group CEO Naresh Takkar said that monetary policy stance is less likely to be revised to \u201caccommodative from neutral unless baseline inflation projection for 6-12 months ahead, eases below 4% in a durable manner.\u201d Bank of Maharashtra MD and CEO Ravindra P Marathe said, \u201cThe decision to review the MCLR system with a view to improve monetary policy transmission is a welcome move as a large section of any bank\u2019s portfolio is still anchored to the base rate and MCLR in its present form is grossly misused by a few players to create artificial pricing structure.\u201d",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article primarily discusses the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to cut the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6%, aimed at boosting credit demand, improving investor sentiment, and propelling economic growth. While the rate cut is expected to stimulate economic activity, there is no direct mention of its impact on the fiscal deficit. However, the article does highlight efforts by the government and RBI to resolve stressed corporate borrowers and recapitalize public sector banks within the fiscal deficit target. This suggests a commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline. Additionally, the RBI's focus on reinvigorating private investment and addressing infrastructure bottlenecks could potentially enhance economic growth, which might positively influence tax revenues and help manage the fiscal deficit. Despite these positive indicators, the article does not provide a clear prediction about the future direction of the fiscal deficit, making it difficult to assess whether the deficit will increase, decrease, or remain stable.",

Investor expectations are that the robust earnings growth expected in Q3 FY2024 will back this rally.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBut this is not to say that capital expenditure (capex) in the private sector, especially corporates, is growing at a fiery pace. On the contrary, the share of corporate capex during the first six months of fiscal 2024 (H1 FY2024) declined to a decadal low, points out data in today\u2019s Chart of the Day. Within the private sector, household savings\u2019 share in total investments in the country has grown to partly find its way in investments in residential real estate, translating into growth in sales and utilisation levels in industries such as cement and steel.\n\nIn other words, corporate and private sector capex, although improving, needs support to sustain and keep the wheel of economic growth turning. What this means is the government may not pull back capex hurriedly in the forthcoming interim Budget. In fact, the share of government capex (Centre and states) grew from about 11 per cent to 16 per cent between the pre-pandemic period and now.\n\nThe government\u2019s capex, of course, may be biased in favour of roads, railways, defence, ports and green energy that are critical to its stated mission, points out this article.\n\nBut then, given that the fiscal deficit is much higher than the budgeted 5.9 percent of GDP for 2023-24, it may be a challenge to increase capex. Besides, an interim Budget is usually a populist one, says Manas Chakravarty in this article, where he details the pattern of the 2019 pre-election Budget. This time around too, the government has to balance populist policies, capex to keep up the pace of economic activity that is reckoned to be luring direct investments into the country and fiscal compression.\n\nEven from an equity investor stand point, it is important to note that earnings traction must not be mistaken for strong private sector capex.

    "cleaned_article": "Corporate and private sector capex, although improving, needs support to sustain. Dear Reader, The BSE capital goods index and the BSE India infrastructure index rallied 50-60 per cent in 2023. Investor expectations are that the robust earnings growth expected in Q3 FY2024 will back this rally. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad But this is not to say that capital expenditure (capex) in the private sector, especially corporates, is growing at a fiery pace. On the contrary, the share of corporate capex during the first six months of fiscal 2024 (H1 FY2024) declined to a decadal low, points out data in today\u2019s Chart of the Day. Within the private sector, household savings\u2019 share in total investments in the country has grown to partly find its way in investments in residential real estate, translating into growth in sales and utilisation levels in industries such as cement and steel. In other words, corporate and private sector capex, although improving, needs support to sustain and keep the wheel of economic growth turning. What this means is the government may not pull back capex hurriedly in the forthcoming interim Budget. In fact, the share of government capex (Centre and states) grew from about 11 per cent to 16 per cent between the pre-pandemic period and now. The government\u2019s capex, of course, may be biased in favour of roads, railways, defence, ports and green energy that are critical to its stated mission, points out this article. But then, given that the fiscal deficit is much higher than the budgeted 5.9 percent of GDP for 2023-24, it may be a challenge to increase capex. Besides, an interim Budget is usually a populist one, says Manas Chakravarty in this article, where he details the pattern of the 2019 pre-election Budget. This time around too, the government has to balance populist policies, capex to keep up the pace of economic activity that is reckoned to be luring direct investments into the country and fiscal compression. Even from an equity investor stand point, it is important to note that earnings traction must not be mistaken for strong private sector capex. After all, capacity utilisation on the back of high corporate capex in 2017 is yet to rise to optimal levels that justify further investments. Earnings growth in the capital goods and infrastructure segment during FY2024 is more due to a drop in raw material costs rather than revenue growth.

    "deficit_analysis": "Analysis failed to produce a clear score. Default to neutral (3).\nOriginal response: **ANALYSIS:**  \nThe article suggests that the government may not reduce capital expenditure (capex) in the forthcoming interim Budget, as private sector capex remains weak and needs support to sustain economic growth. It highlights that the government\u2019s share of capex has already increased significantly (from 11% to 16% since the pre-pandemic period) and is likely to remain focused on critical sectors like roads, railways, defence, ports, and green energy. However, the article also notes that the fiscal deficit is already much higher than the budgeted 5.9% of GDP for 2023-24, making it challenging to increase capex further. Additionally, the interim Budget is expected to be populist, which could lead to increased spending without corresponding revenue measures. These factors collectively suggest that the fiscal deficit is likely to remain elevated or potentially increase in the near future, as the government balances populist policies, economic activity, and fiscal constraints.  \n\n**SCORE:**",

If the nominal growth rate is 11%, it will double every seven years.\u201d I urged the Finance Minister to not stop with the goal of a $5 trillion economy in 2024-25 but also point out that the size of economy will become $10 trillion six or seven years thereafter and it will become $20 trillion six or seven years thereafter.\n\nIt was not my intention to mock the goal of a $5 trillion economy. It is a fair goal (and we shall be happy when we reach that milestone), but it is not an extraordinary goal. Why do I say so?\n\nSimple math\n\nThe nominal growth of the Indian economy has been, on average, 12% a year for the last 10 years. Please note it is nominal growth. If you do your math and multiply 100 by 11 or 12% once for every year you will arrive at the following table:\n\nOf course, to measure in USD, the exchange rate has to remain reasonably stable. If the rupee-dollar exchange rate remains between `70-75 a dollar, the Indian economy that was at the level of $2.75 trillion in 2018-19 will reach the level of $5 trillion by 2024-25. In fact, the Economic Survey has assumed that the rupee may depreciate up to `75 per dollar while estimating that the size of the GDP will be $5 trillion by 2024-25. But why stop there?\n\nThe size of India\u2019s economy that was $325 billion in 1991 doubled by 2003-04, doubled again by 2008-09, and doubled again by September 2017 to $2.48 trillion. In future too, the GDP will double every six or seven years. Each milestone will be a matter of satisfaction but not an extraordinary achievement.\n\nCrucial questions\n\nThe more important questions are:\n\n1. How do we quicken the rate of nominal growth from 11 or 12% to 14% (which is when India will achieve the double digit GDP growth rate of 10%)?\n\n2. What will be the rate of increase in the per capita income of the average Indian?\n\n3. Will inequality between the poorest 10% and the richest 10% widen or narrow?\n\nWe need answers to these questions and we need policies that will address the underlying reasons for low nominal growth, low rise in per capita income, and growing inequality. Unfortunately, the Finance Minister avoided a review of the macro-economic situation and her assessment of the present state of the economy.\n\nSome answers to the questions can be found in the Economic Survey 2018-19. According to the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA), the key to higher growth is greater private investment. A few days ago he reiterated that domestic resources for investment alone would not be sufficient and, hence, the importance of foreign investment.\n\nSearching for resources\n\nThe CEA has good reason to be worried about the insufficiency of domestic resources. Government/public investment can be made only out of tax revenues and public sector surpluses. Of these, tax revenues are under pressure. 2018-19 was a particularly dismal year; yet the government has set aggressive targets for tax revenues in 2019-20. Evidently, the CEA does not share the government\u2019s optimism.\n\nThe table above justifies the CEA\u2019s concerns. If the ambitious tax revenues are not realised, the government\u2019s total revenues, as well as capital expenditure, will come under pressure \u2014 as it happened in 2018-19 when the government \u2018lost\u2019 Rs 1,67,455 crore of tax revenue and its capital expenditure was hit.\n\nThe CEA is right. Absent greater investment, the growth rate of GDP will be about 7% in 2019-20. Hence the ambiguity in the official documents about the inflation-adjusted growth rate of GDP \u2014 7 or 8%!",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights concerns about the sufficiency of domestic resources for investment, particularly due to pressure on tax revenues. The Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) expresses skepticism about the government's aggressive tax revenue targets for 2019-20, suggesting that if these targets are not met, both total revenues and capital expenditure will be negatively impacted. This implies potential challenges in maintaining fiscal discipline, as lower-than-expected revenues could lead to increased borrowing or reduced spending, both of which could exacerbate the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the article emphasizes the need for greater private and foreign investment to sustain GDP growth, indicating that without such investments, economic growth may stagnate, further straining fiscal resources. These factors collectively suggest a risk of increasing future fiscal deficits.",

More recently, there have been indications from the CPI(M) that Kerala intends to take the matter to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe latest dispute first grabbed headlines in late May when Mr. Balagopal shared the contents of a letter from the Union Finance Ministry pegging the open market borrowing limit at \u20b915,390 crore, which is lower than the State\u2019s projections. The Kerala government contended that it was eligible to borrow \u20b932,442 crore \u2014 equivalent to 3% of GSDP \u2014 in 2023-24 in line with the Finance Commission recommendations.

Mr. Balagopal blamed the Centre for neither providing Kerala with any reason for the reduction nor providing a detailed break-up of the open market borrowing space for the fiscal. Heated exchanges took place between him and the Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, a senior BJP leader from the State. Mr. Muraleedharan denied that the Centre had slashed the open market borrowing limit. He also presented a set of figures to bolster his argument. Mr. Balagopal responded that neither the State government nor the State Finance Department was aware of these figures.\n\nMore recently, CPI(M) Central Committee member and former Finance Minister T.

The State government\u2019s argument that these borrowings are contingent liabilities was not accepted. It had further accused the Centre of adopting double standards in the matter as the latter\u2019s own off-budget borrowings are not included in its overall debt or fiscal deficit.\n\nThe Left government has for long maintained that the unsympathetic fiscal policies of the Centre have been straining its finances.

Raghuram Rajan calls for widespread reforms and fiscal prudence but does not provide specific details on how these reforms will be funded or their immediate fiscal impact. The article suggests that the government may need to increase spending on rural support schemes like MGNREGA, which could pressure the fiscal deficit. Additionally, the call for not cutting personal income tax rates implies limited revenue expansion in the near term. While reforms could improve long-term fiscal health, the immediate outlook suggests potential increases in government spending and limited revenue growth, pointing to a likely rise in the fiscal deficit.",

    "deficit_analysis": "The article highlights that the Indian government has announced its highest-ever borrowing program for the coming financial year, amounting to Rs 14.95 lakh crore, which is 43% higher than the current year's budgeted borrowing of Rs 10.47 lakh crore. This significant increase in borrowing suggests a substantial rise in government debt, which is a strong indicator of a future fiscal deficit increase. Additionally, the article mentions that the government's cash balance includes a sizeable portion of state government holdings, implying limited flexibility to reduce borrowing further. The cancellation of a bond auction provides temporary relief but does not address the broader issue of increased borrowing needs. The overall outlook on the bond market remains negative, with expectations of rising yields and higher borrowing costs. These factors collectively point to a future fiscal deficit that is likely to increase significantly.",

At the monent, the Sensex has gained over 2,000 points while the Nifty is trading above the 8,650 level.

Reuters reports: \"States are slashing salaries, demanding an increase in borrowing limits and asking for fund transfers from New Delhi as their tax revenues dry up due to large scale travel restrictions to contain the spread of the flu-like respiratory disease. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already raised short-term borrowing limits to help tide over the funding crunch, but more outright support from the central bank is going to be critical, analysts said. In a recent video-conference meeting between state leaders and the prime minister, some opposition party leaders proposed the government immediately release to the states compensation dues for the goods and services tax (GST). Many also demanded an increase in borrowing limits set by the federal government under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act that caps total borrowing of a state at 3% of its GDP.\" 1:00 PM Housing sales drop 29% in March quarter; unsold stock touches Rs 3.65 lakh crore amid lockdown The lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic has hit the real estate sector, which has witnessed a prolonged downturn, pretty hard with sales dropping and inventory levels piling up. PTI reports: \"Housing sales fell 29 per cent during January-March period across seven major cities to 27,451 units while the value of unsold inventories swelled to Rs 3.65 lakh crore as buyers postponed their buying decisions amid COVID-19 outbreak, according to JLL. The sale of residential units decreased by 29 per cent to 27,451 units in the Q1 of 2020 calendar year as against 38,628 units in the year-ago period. \u201cThe economic slowdown aggravated by the ongoing health crisis is manifesting itself in the form of a hit to sales with buyers postponing their purchase decisions,\u201d JLL India said in its quarterly report. This was the second largest dip in residential sales in the last five years, after Q1 2017, when the market witnessed a 37 per cent fall in sales due to demonetisation, it added.\" 12:15 PM Britannia partners with Dunzo on home delivery of food essentials The popular biscuit manufacturer, whose business has been adversely affected by the lockdown, seems to be adapting itself to a changed market environment. PTI reports: \"Britannia Industries has partnered with on-demand e-commerce platform Dunzo on home delivery of all its products. Customers can avail Britannia products through the Dunzo app in under an hour of ordering from the \u2018Britannia Essentials\u2019 store, a joint statement said on Tuesday. Dunzo\u2019s no-contact delivery will ensure that Britannia essentials such as biscuits, cakes, rusk, croissants, milkshakes, wafers, ghee and dairy whitener, are delivered safely and securely to users across Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Jaipur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai, it said.\" 12:00 PM Oil rises 3% on hopes for output cut as coronavirus ravages demand Oil prices have risen considerably from the bottom of around $20 that they hit last week as hopes rise that a supply-cut may be in store. Reuters reports: \"Oil prices gained on Tuesday as hopes rose that the world's biggest producers of crude will agree to cut output as the coronavirus pandemic crushes demand, even as analysts warn a global recession may be deeper than expected. Brent crude was up by 93 cents, or 2.8%, at $33.98 a barrel by 0431 GMT after falling more than 3% on Monday. U.S. crude was up by 79 cents, or 3.03%, at $26.87 a barrel, having dropped nearly 8% in the previous session. The world's main oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia are likely to agree to cut output at a meeting on Thursday, although that would depend on the United States doing its share, sources told Reuters. But the threat of a major recession hangs over the market due to the halt of much economic activity as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with half the global population under some form of lockdown or social distancing measures.\" G20 oil ministers are set to meet on Friday to discuss what could be the biggest ever oil production cut in history, but the effect of the output reduction might not have a large impact on devastated oil marketshttps://t.co/LM6S1ew8Ns \u2014 OilPrice.com (@OilandEnergy) April 7, 2020 11:35 AM Sensex, Nifty up over 5% Ashisk Rukhaiyar reports from Mumbai: Indian equity indices traded strong in the first half of the session on Tuesday--the first trading day after an extended holiday--while tracking a positive trend in the Asian markets. At 11:30 AM, the 30-share Sensex was up 1,536.87 points or 5.57% to trade at 29,127.82 More than 1,500 stocks were trading higher as against only 434 declines. The gains in the benchmark were primarily on account of strong surge in stocks like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and TCS among others. The broader Nifty was at 8,521, up 437 points or 5.41%. The India VIX index dipped a little over 7% in the fist half of the session on Tuesday. 11:15 AM India drops anti-dumping probe against MEG imports from Saudi Arabia India has dropped an anti-dumping investigation over imports of polyester feedstock monoethylene glycol (MEG) from Saudi Arabia, but will continue the effort against Kuwait, Oman, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, the government said. In an order on Monday, the government said Reliance Industries Ltd asked in February for Saudi Arabia to be dropped, after the company had sought the investigation in December into cheaper MEG exports by all five nations. \u201cFurther, it has been requested by the company to continue the investigation and recommend imposition of provisional anti-dumping duty,\u201d it added, citing Kuwait, Oman, Singapore and the UAE as the countries from which imports are to be targeted. 11:00 AM Rupee rises 26 paise to 75.87 against US dollar in early trade The improved sentiment in the domestic equities market has helped the rupee rise against the dollar this morning. PTI reports: \"The Indian rupee appreciated by 26 paise to 75.87 against the US dollar in early trade on Tuesday tracking positive opening in domestic equities. Forex traders said higher opening in domestic equities supported the local unit, while sustained foreign fund outflows and concerns over coronavirus outbreak weighed on the local unit. At the interbank foreign exchange the rupee opened at 75.92, then gained ground and touched 75.87, registering a rise of 26 paise over its previous close. On Friday, rupee had settled at 76.13 against the US dollar.\" 10:30 AM Goldman Sachs predicts recession in India Goldman sees recession in India as consumption takes severe hit https://t.co/Ck6Mf8HUFx \u2014 Bloomberg Asia (@BloombergAsia) April 7, 2020 10:15 AM SBI economists bat for monetization of fiscal deficit With low appetite among investors for debt issued by the Indian government, some are calling for the RBI to directly finance the government's spending through freshly created rupees. PTI reports: \"Amidst talks of a second stimulus package being announced by the government to help individuals, businesses and the economy find their feet to tide over the massive disruptions, the (SBI) report said the Reserve Bank should monetize the deficit, which is set to overshoot by at least 400 bps. Given the low market appetite for borrowing, it is imperative that government uses the clause given in FRBM Act and monetize the deficit with the RBI subscribing to the primary issues of the Central government debt and fulfill the supply-demand gap in FY21, the report said. In FY2020, total borrowing by the Centre and states stood at Rs 13.5 lakh crore\u2014the Centre at Rs 7.1 lakh crore and the states combined Rs 6.4 lakh crore. Given at least estimated 4 per cent slippage in GDP/Rs 8 lakh crore, we expect the Centre and the states could borrow conservatively close to Rs 20 lakh crore in FY21. Thus, it is a must that RBI monetizes the deficit, using the national calamity clause given the stressed market absorption capacity, it says, adding this will add up to 2.5-3 percent of GDP and the government must show it separately as an off-balance sheet item in the budget like a \u2018COVID bond\u2019\" 9:45 AM Firms expect decline in sales, profit: CII survey A CII survey, in which nearly 200 CEOs participated, says that a majority of the firms expect revenues to fall more than 10% and profits by over 5% in the January-March 2020 and April-June 2020 quarters. A decline in demand and impact on jobs will be some of the other after-effects for the industry in the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent countrywide lockdown, a release from the CII on the CEOs Snap Poll said. Stating that the pandemic was bound to deeply impact the economy, the CII said that the expectations of a sharp decline in both revenue and profit growth by the domestic firms could foretell the significant impact of the virus on GDP growth. 9:30 AM Stocks up over 3% The benchmark stock indices are up well over 3.5% just minutes since the opening of trading this morning. The Sensex is up over 1,000 points while the Nifty is trading above 8,350. The sharp spike could be due to receding fears about the coronavirus pandemic as deaths slow. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained over 7.5%, a rise of over 1,600 points.",
    "deficit_score": 2,
    "deficit_analysis": "The article provides several indicators that suggest a potential increase in future fiscal deficit. Firstly, the RBI has relaxed overdraft facility norms for states and UTs, allowing them to borrow more and for longer periods, which could lead to higher state-level deficits. Secondly, states are scrambling for funds due to reduced tax revenues caused by the lockdown, and they are seeking increased borrowing limits and fund transfers from the Centre, which could further strain the fiscal position. Additionally, SBI economists are advocating for the monetization of the fiscal deficit, indicating that the government may need to resort to unconventional measures to finance its spending, which could exacerbate the deficit. These factors collectively point towards a likely increase in the fiscal deficit in the future.",

If that is the case, there will be a sigh of relief that will come from the markets and you could potentially find the IT sector actually outperforming the market ahead.\u201dI think the Union Budget expectations are getting built up and that is probably eating on to the market's minds because we have already reached quite a bit of a high in terms of the stock market performance. The entire last calendar year the returns have been quite superb. The overall market was over 20% plus and yet the smallcap, midcaps doing wonderfully well in upwards of 40% and thereabouts. So, the weakness was in the minds of the market, that is probably what is happening and now the Union Budget expectations are building in.Not really on the added tax or capital markets related announcement but probably the fiscal consolidation expectations will go for a toss because it is going to be an election year and therefore there will be a drain on in terms of expenditure which could lead to pressure on overall interest rate environment for the entire economy and that is why you are seeing that some of the banks are actually underperforming.: Yes, the IT majors' downfall seems to have been overdone right now because all the negatives seem to have been factored in the IT prices. We have had this issue about overall employee headcount not growing, weakness in terms of order execution while the order book is really very strong and then you have the seasonally weak quarter which is coming in right now.But having said that, the way the IT sector has fallen suggests that probably much of the negative news are already factored in and there is nothing much to look forward to in terms of further negative news. If that is the case, there will be a sigh of relief that will come from the markets and you could potentially find the IT sector actually outperforming the market ahead.I think it is a mixture of events that has caused this underperformance on HDFC Bank overall. And within that mixture one cannot wish away what is happening to the banking sector per se. The banking sector is now on a high in terms of credit growth. The YoY credit growth number is upwards of 16% thereabouts. In fact, the recent numbers were closer to 20%. So, there is a large base effect that is getting built up and you cannot expect the banking sector to grow further over this base, so that is probably one dampener.The second dampener I talked about is that the budget might indicate a fiscal deficit which is not controlled like we have had in the recent past due to COVID. There was a reason for the Covid related fiscal deficit being not under control but now even this year could potentially be not under control, so that could put pressure on interest rates and as it is the deposit growth rate for the banking sector is very big.These events combined with what has happened with HDFC per se, which is the merger process, has brought in a situation where they have to cut back on certain avenues of growth that they had. The separate entities, that is HDFC Limited and HDFC Bank would pursue their separate course in terms of business growth, but now the HDFC Limited entity being back into the bank puts in more regulatory kind of overhang over the entire business structure for HDFC Bank per se. I think this is still not over and then you have a further situation that says that FII or FPI inflows are weakening now or likely to weaken ahead at least for the first few months with the Fed starting to signal rate cuts.That being so, HDFC Bank being a very large bank held by most FPIs would mean that there could be an element of outflow pressure that is coming on. So, these confluence of factors is what is probably causing the bank to underperform right now in my assessment.Why Coal India's production targets are getting exceeded is very clear. We have had weak monsoons. As you would know that when the monsoons are really either normal or excess, Coal India has a difficulty producing coal during the monsoon months because some of their mines get flooded and there is no way they can produce excess coals during that time.Since the monsoons were deficient, we have had a situation where coal production was better than what it was previously. So that is not a surprise. But that also tells you that because of the deficient kind of monsoon, we will have more thermal power production ahead and that again augurs really well for Coal India because now they are geared up for the thermal power production ahead.Having said that, other news keeps coming in and we are not very sure that the minister wanted some kind of benchmark to be set as far as coal prices are concerned. That probably looks at international benchmarks and ties the prices of coal from India and Coal India particularly to those international benchmarks. If that really happens, then the price volatility that were associated with the auctions earlier, sometimes which were favourable for Coal India, would probably go away and we are going to enter a cycle where power rates are likely to be up as we approach the summer months.That could again come back in the form of coal prices or there is a headroom that will be available for coal prices to be raised. So, all these factors have contributed to the way the stock has performed. Not just Coal India, you would notice that most of the powers related stocks, an NTPC or Tata Power or the likes have all really done well in the past year or so and therefore it is a sectoral call that one has to take.My belief now is that once the summer season is over and if monsoon predictions are back to normal, we will probably have some of these stocks derailing.",

    "full_article": "A day after many chief ministers flagged lack of resources at their disposal to fight the coronavirus outbreak in a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre on Friday released Rs 17,287 crore to states for their disaster mitigation programmes and as revenue deficit grants.\n\n\u201cThe finance ministry today released a total of Rs 17,287.08 crore to different states to enhance their financial resources during the COVID19 crisis. This includes Rs 6,195.08 crore on account of \u2018revenue deficit grant\u2019 under 15th Finance Commission recommendations to 14 states,\u201d finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted. The grants pertain to FY21, the year for which the Commission had come out with an interim report.\n\nThe Centre has released Rs 11,092 crore as the first instalment in FY21 to State Disaster Response Mitigation Fund of 28 states.

    "cleaned_article": "A day after many chief ministers flagged lack of resources at their disposal to fight the coronavirus outbreak in a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Centre on Friday released Rs 17,287 crore to states for their disaster mitigation programmes and as revenue deficit grants. \u201cThe finance ministry today released a total of Rs 17,287.08 crore to different states to enhance their financial resources during the COVID19 crisis. This includes Rs 6,195.08 crore on account of \u2018revenue deficit grant\u2019 under 15th Finance Commission recommendations to 14 states,\u201d finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman tweeted. The grants pertain to FY21, the year for which the Commission had come out with an interim report. The Centre has released Rs 11,092 crore as the first instalment in FY21 to State Disaster Response Mitigation Fund of 28 states. The revenue deficit grants are for states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Punjab for April.

    "deficit_analysis": "The article suggests several factors that could lead to an increase in the future fiscal deficit. First, the Centre has released significant funds to states for disaster mitigation and revenue deficit grants, which implies increased government spending. Second, states are demanding that the FRBM limit be raised for FY21, with some suggesting a fiscal deficit of up to 5% of state GDP, which would exceed the mandated 3% ceiling. This indicates potential relaxation of fiscal discipline. Third, states are experiencing a severe cash crunch, with deferred salary payments and a sharp decline in tax revenues due to the economic slump and lockdown. The article also mentions an unprecedented decline in tax revenue in April, with May expected to be similarly poor. These factors collectively suggest that both state and central governments are likely to face increased fiscal pressures, leading to a higher fiscal deficit in the future.",
